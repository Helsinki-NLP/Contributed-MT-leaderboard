Not only does it confirm an already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides details, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement, that fossils cannot usually provide.
Scientists describe the animal's plumage as chestnut-brown above and light or carotenoid-colored below.
This discovery shed light on the origin of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but have other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers think the rachis may have been a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature control or display. The researchers commented that even if this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen indicates full feathers.
Although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers say the specimen shows an adult, not a juvenile, fringe.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters stand alone in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope showing their preferred candidate.
Once the officials verify the voter's identity document, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting roll.

Candidates can send delegates to witness all parts of the process. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under close supervision following prescribed procedures.

The shooters should be closely monitored by the rangers in the accompanying pest control trial as the trial has been observed and its effectiveness assessed.
Eligible volunteers were recruited in partnership with NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. in the Sporting Shooters Association Talent Search Program.
According to the Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Heritage NPWS, Mick O'Flynn, the 4 shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
A new nine-member Provisional Election Committee (CEP) was sworn in by Martelly yesterday.
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission had recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of measures to move the country towards fresh elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The occasionally violent protests have been motivated by the failure to hold elections, which are due in 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of overheating and misuse of iPods have been reported, resulting in 6 fires and 4 minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
"Last week, the METI reported that Apple had reported 34 incidents of overheating, which the company called ""not serious""".
"Calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable", the ministry said".
The impact of the earthquake in Mariana was felt at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m.
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office reported no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami warning.
A former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking a bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including adults and children, were released first, along with Filipino photographers.
When the photographers arrived at the home of an elderly woman who needed the toilet, Mendoza was shot and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, in his spare time, Liggins began researching preterm birth.
His research showed that if a hormone is administered, it can accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Two 'black box' flight recorders were recovered by government investigators on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy said to the dreamer, ""Luna was the most important queen. She was my first manager. Luna died on the night of the 2nd moon.
"The Dustin "Goldust" Journals commented ""Luna is as weird as I am...maybe a little more...love her and definitely miss her...hope she's in a better place".""
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she thought Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this opinion, with Queen Elizabeth II wanting to be Australia's last monarch.
After the election, 29 per cent of respondents believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, but 31 per cent believed Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m, 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was in doubt, according to his complaint.
Even though he was in pain, he couldn't take his meds because they were banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and made the announcement on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth, as well as organic materials that could be turned into proteins that could support life.
Since comets have collided with the earth in the distant past, scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially the earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
"He described the rumors as ""political talk and nonsense""".
He is widely expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes while saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology to replace older ground-based radar-based technology, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide more precise information to pilots.
There is no additional traffic, no overground trains stop at Wembley, and no car parking or park and ride facilities at the ground.
The lack of transportation raised concerns that the teams would have to play without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the introduction of a new species of bird to the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within 2 generations, although it was believed that the process took longer, due to breeding between the Darwin finch, Geospisa fortis, and the migrant cactus finch, Geospisa coniorostris.
Gold can be made into any shape, rolled into any shape.
It can be made into thin wires that can be twisted and twisted, it can be stretched and rolled into sheets.
"It can be made very thin and can be glued to other metals. It can be made very thin and was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called ""illuminated manuscripts""".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the juice changes depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms contain 1 proton and 1 electron).
2 Roll the dry powders together and squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which is interesting and creates a kind of a crust.
Every household in Harappa and Mohenjodaro had flush toilets with an innovative sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan houses in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of a public bathhouse, sometimes used by both men and women.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The space satellite receives the call and transmits it down instantly.
Because the earth's atmosphere affects light and our vision, scientists use telescopes to look into space.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has transformed the world in unique ways, and the greatest thing it has given us is easy and fast transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and a lot of other modes of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to giraffes and deer.
Finally, there were a large number of felines (including pets) that fed on prey such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the common belief that Niche assigns each cat a specific job to prevent them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides 1-3 are made up of associated adult males, along with up to thirty women and children.
Women are closely related to each other as a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
The majesty of the lion acts much like packs of wolves or dogs. The animals are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior. They are also very deadly to their prey.
An accomplished athlete, the tiger can climb to great heights, swim (albeit poorly), leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers belong to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and tigers. Only these 4 species are capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full roar of the lion, but like a roaring, screaming phrase of words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can. Almost all animals preyed upon by the ocelot are much smaller than that.
Scientists believe that ocelots locate their prey by following their sense of smell, detecting where they are.
Their excellent night vision enables them to see very well and move very quickly. Ocelots catch their prey by blending into their surroundings and jumping on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small number) becomes separated from the main group they were in (they move to a mountain range, a riverbank, or move to an island from which they cannot easily return) they often end up in an environment very different from what they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than it needed before.
The original populations have not changed at all, and they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new generations begin to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will look too different to be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is the inevitable consequence and the most important transformation.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take up the carbon dioxide that humans breathe (i.e., exhale).
Plants use photosynthesis to make food from the sun. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from trees, we make our clothes from trees, most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without forests, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the strongest animal of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long snout was studded with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and it had another set in the roof of its mouth, which meant that nothing could escape its eyes.
We're not sure, but it had a forked tongue, and its diet consisted of turtles, large fish and reptiles, and it may have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't keep up.
Much of the Roman diet may be familiar to us today, but they had some strange or exotic foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and dormouses.
Another difference is that the poor and women eat their meals sitting on chairs, while the rich prefer banquets, where they eat leaning sideways.
The ancient Roman diet of later centuries did not include foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa. Ancient Romans had never tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians considered each of their gods to be the central figure in a great temple complex.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to meet the gods' needs by performing rituals and holding festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner courtyard accessible only by the priests.
Pyramid-shaped towers, sometimes called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climates of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Much of Hebrew family life takes place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; stores were just counters open to the street.
The land of Canaan had few forests, so timber was highly valued.
In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from the island for murder, and as he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might sometimes think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although written on the back of the document, it was not a treasure map.
"The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence read ""The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776"". The text appears upside down at the very bottom of the document".
Although no one knows who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was initially rolled up for storage.
So, a notation is simply a label added to a probability.
Although the D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, French people who had made a pact with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, Allied forces invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France from the Germans.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city-state, and in some ways defines the plurality of society.
City-states were precursors to nations. A civilized culture refers to the transmission of knowledge over many generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and appropriate propaganda.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, under the Articles of Confederation - with Congress as its only component - thirteen states initially formed weak central governments.
Congress had no power to levy taxes and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, relied on often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its acts.
It did not have the power to overrule tariff and tax laws between states.
It required the unanimous consent of all the States before it could be amended, but the States were very lenient with the Central Government and their representatives were often not present.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful national football team in the world, after Germany, and the winner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and the Olympics.
Japan consists of 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
"Because Japan consists of a group of islands, according to geographical criteria, Japan is called an ""archipelago""".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in tribal grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the warlords of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. They ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists an idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the world's most common still image photography format is 35mm. This was a popular film size in the late analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
So the absolute ratio of this format (when divided by twelve to get the simplest integer) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family formats) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The Rule of Thirds is a simple guideline for creating a dynamic in an image while maintaining orderly proportions.
The most effective location for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church faced the Inquisition.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states across language and culture.
It is an all-pervasive force that affects everyone from the king to the common man.
An important Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that is what the church treasury is for.
For thousands of years, the Church has been dominated by Rome and this concentration of power and money has led many to question the validity of these documents.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
However, the blockade has proven effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though it violates generally accepted international law codified in numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, endangering even neutral ships.
Receiving limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to their unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, most citizens in most countries wanted peace and isolation.
Recognizing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repetition of such atrocities.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former work manager).
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each period of China or each dynasty in power was a distinct dynasty.
Each dynasty had an unstable period of provinces divided between them. One of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there was a fierce struggle between the various nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, when thousands died fighting for the top spot in Xi'an's prized palace.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from authoritarianism to democracy, nationalism, the idea that the country belongs to the people and not to the rulers.
After the revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants, allowing all who aspired to succeed.
The same applies to the Army as military rankings are now based on merit instead of class.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutionary movements.
The Prophet Muhammad was concerned with things beyond this earthly life. He regularly went to meditate in a cave called Hira in the mountain of "Noor" (Light).
The cave itself, which has survived time, gives a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, it is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know it exists, and once you're trapped in a cave, you're isolated.
From inside the cave, only a small part of this world can be seen or heard. The cave is surrounded by mountains, and the sky is clear and beautiful.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of several large pyramidal structures built in honor of the late pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau or ""Giza Necropolis"" in Egypt is the site of several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The largest pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The ""up-bow"" sign looks like a V, and the ""down-bow"" sign looks like a hook or a square, missing its bottom.
Up means you start at the tip and push the bow, down means you start at the frog (where you hold the bow in your hand) and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually produces a soft sound, while a down-bow produces a strong and firm sound.
Feel free to pencil in your own marks, but remember that there are printed bowings marks for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The panicked King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their 2 grandchildren (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, forced a group of market women back from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage while a crowd shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows.
At one point a member of the crowd pointed out to the queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The cost of the war to U.S. imperialism in the occupation of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial administration through Wall Street banking houses, in large part to finance the costs and the interest on the bonds held by the Philippine government.
Of course, the basic achievement of U.S. imperialism is the great profits made from the long exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context of their creation and the context that inspired it.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Early Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a range of practical ideas, ranging from technology-push or technological necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an inherent logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Technological determinism shares two ideas in common: that the development of technology itself is transcendent to cultural and political influences, and that technology is instead intrinsic to, and commonly conditioned by, society.
For example, one may say that the development of roads is essential for motor cars.
However, a nationwide road network for gasoline cars is not economically successful, so new production methods are developed that reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Increased car ownership leads to more accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new technologies in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large component of cultural tradition derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic Movement, the landscape influenced individuals and over time gave rise to customs and culture associated with that landscape, which conformed to the position of the society better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is known as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its reputation declined in the 12th century mainly due to the Crusaders returning gifts such as silk and spices, which were more highly valued than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the name of the fashion capital was changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and again in the 14th century.
Dress was initially heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communications, Westerners will be 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is the practice of producing food solely to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is simple and often subsistence, and to increase yields, intercropping or other relatively simple techniques are used in this system in coordination with seeds preserved in an environmentally protected area.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
A subculture is a group of like-minded people who feel neglected by society's norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ because of the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographic, or a combination of various factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership in distinctive and symbolic ways, including fashion, mannerisms, and casual speech.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to identify some of the unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up and went through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
"Such children are referred to as ""feral"" or feral. Some children who cannot be controlled are detained by people (usually their own parents); in some cases children are abandoned because of parental rejection of the child's intellectual or physical disability".
Children must have suffered severe abuse and trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some claim to have been raised by animals; others say they lived in the wild.
Feral children raised by non-human animals display behaviors (within physical limits) similar to those of the animal that raised them, such as fear of humans and avoidance of humans.
While project-based learning can make learning easier and more fun, layering goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a facilitator that supports individuals as they are exposed to a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both imaginary and real, in other words, just as the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office can be a scaffold, so can a teacher.
Virtual scaffolds are internalised in the software and are meant to question, request and explain procedures that can be challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abduction to abuse.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they are not nurtured, cared for and educated, but they are.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, sustainable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that they previously took for granted, but don't have at home.
The Internet combines elements of social and personal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of usability and accessibility.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socializing"" have been cited as major motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)".
"""Personal role"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were identified by Eime and McCord (1998) as new motivating factors when investigating audience responses to websites".
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, lasting a few milliseconds, which are interpreted as facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that if microexpressions are correctly interpreted, one can tell if someone is lying.
In his essay The Presidential Speech, Oliver Sacks points out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can accurately assess sincerity.
He suggests that domestic animals such as dogs may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutation creates new genetic variation, selectively removing it from the pool of expressed variation.
Separation and recombination alternate between the two types of variation in each generation.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for a marsupial with a digestive system similar to humans to meet amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences such as stunting, malnutrition and ultimately death.
Although the proteins found in leaves and legumes are the most readily available in plant sources, they are difficult to digest in primates like us unless cooked and used.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide plenty of proteins containing essential amino acids.
"All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their ""protein problem"" much as savannah chimpanzees do today".
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep time and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
An alarm clock with a relatively low volume can also easily bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you determine to reset the clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluid (water or tea, which are known diuretics) before bed, forcing 1 person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace is inversely related to the level of stress in their body and mind.
As stress decreases, enthusiasm for life becomes more positive. Each individual has the potential for finding complete peace and contentment.
One of the things that happens when we get in the way of that goal is that we get caught up in our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it spread through the Mahayana path of love and many of the techniques from Indian yoga.
In essence, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple and includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In kundalini yoga, kundalini ojas (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and insight.
Deti yoga is the focus of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy sources are purified, the chakras are activated, and a sense of wisdom is created.
The fact that Germany was a common enemy in World War II led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. As the war ended, clashes of system, process, and culture made the countries enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies are now enemies, and the Cold War has begun.
It would last for the next 40 years, fighting on battlefields from Africa to Asia, and with shadow armies in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Polish resistance had collapsed. The only hope was to retreat through the Romanian bridgehead and regroup.
However, plans such as the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties became obsolete almost overnight after the Soviet Union invaded Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, entering 800,000 troops from the Red Army and creating the Belarusian and Crimean Fronts.
Ships are the most efficient means of transporting large quantities of people and goods at sea.
Traditionally, the Navy's job has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and cargo, while also interfering with the enemy's ability to move people and cargo.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic phase of World War II. Americans attempted to smuggle men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy was attempting to intercept these transports, mainly using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, the rest of Europe was up for grabs and Germany could have conquered Britain.
Sheep are thought to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes cultivated them for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Sheep were raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas. They were often tended by shepherds, children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd.
Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speed and also to pull much larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Cross ties were previously used to hold the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that they would be more efficient if they had a steel layer on top of the tracks.
It's become a common routine, but it's making more hips on the fat wheels of these iron wa guns.
Gradually, iron wheels replaced the wooden ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of locomotion was walking, and humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the rise of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, have not fared as well as usual.
While Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago, bipedal specializations are seen in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly and join the environmental movement, and to some extent we can work to reduce future suffering.
In many cases, it's like treating the symptoms, but if we don't just want a temporary fix, we need to find the root cause of the problems, and we need to disable it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances. Problems have increased greatly because of increased population and mankind's excessive life-styles.
After Congressional approval on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
"Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight and are now published as ""Dunlap Broadsides""".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. No original handwritten copy is available.
A lot of scientists who study fossils today believe that there were one group of dinosaurs left, and they're still alive.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
There's still a lot about birds that looks like a dinosaur.
They have webbed feet and claws, they lay eggs, they walk on their two hind legs like T. rex.
All computers in use today are based on information manipulation coded in binary numbers.
Binary numbers can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits - for use in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are usually present, making a quick diagnosis impossible.
Signs of indoor poisoning may include an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists formally use the term bug.
The term derives from an old familiarity with bed-bugs, insects adapted to live in dependence on humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are parasites, adapted to live in cages or in their native habitat.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child to have custody of the child.
If they wish, these couples can make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the birth parents relinquish all rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method drives most scientific research.
Not only that, however, an experiment, which is a way of eliminating one or more possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations, guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, gained wide acceptance.
With less knowledge of the Greek heritage, the West cut itself off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many experts have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior are often strongly dependent on innate frequencies and their production by the biological clock.
In most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms are recorded, not just in response to external periodic cues.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can operate independently for a period of time even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment is one of the key suggestions that DNA1 is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into an organism.
They performed two experiments, labeling the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus and labeling the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the identity of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Mutations in the germ-line cells can only be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell damage or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts visitors who are taken with the intention of enjoying the natural beauty including flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the habitat.
One example is visiting and studying and photographing orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars for work, passing commuters on their way to their starting point.
This dynamic transportation shuttle is a private car-based transportation system that connects and supports everyone in some way.
Science now suggests that the carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everybody participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everybody complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will not hear similar complaints about poor water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate these kinds of complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonably stable limits; therefore, traffic flow is reasonably uniform and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main features: (1) flow (2) density (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, designing and implementing road infrastructure projects.
Insects were the first creatures to take to the air, and their ability to fly allowed them to evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the remarkable ability to fold their wings close to their bodies.
This gives a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
While some believed that his claim that the solar system, including the sun (and other stars), revolved around the earth was correct, many believed otherwise.
This seems logical, because the Earth itself doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest river on earth and the largest by volume, containing eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon, at six miles wide, is also the widest river on Earth.
The Amazon accounts for 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were unsurpassed for their size and technical excellence.
New Kingdom Ancient Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and one of the most sparsely populated.
Italian is used in Vatican City for legislation and official communication.
Latin is most often used in religious ceremonies but Italian is the language used by most people working in the country.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, all of which can be found naturally in nature and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (in the same order); solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, and he theorized that they could become the new objects we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when available, the pencil was a valued friend to many.
Unfortunately, as new writing systems were introduced, the pencil was downgraded to inferior quality and uses.
Now that people write messages on computer screens, the Sharpener will never be needed.
When something new comes along, one can only wonder what the keyboard will become.
A fission bomb works by storing energy in a nucleus with many neutrons and protons.
Like a heavy shopping cart rolling up a hill, the nucleus splits again, releasing some of its energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they'll break apart with little or no nudging.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The Earth's crust is about 70 kilometers thick and the lateral edge is 100 kilometers.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker in the highlands.
Because the surface is so thin, more maria can be seen nearby, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what causes people to conform or be attracted.
These theories suggest that those who have certain needs and/or desires will internalize them and reach adulthood.
These theories suggest what motivates some people to do certain things, and what things in their environment influence them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory are two popular satisfaction theories.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors are likely to emerge when managers need to manage their former colleagues. One is to try to be ""one of them""".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, handling disciplinary action, performance reviews, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
The second is that you become this unrecognizable person who thinks that he or she has to change everything that the team does and make it their own.
After all, the captain is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often creates a rift between the team captain and the players.
The existing teams had the same excellence as the traditional teams, but with some subtle differences.
Often virtual team members act as the contact point for the physical group in their neighborhood.
Their teams met in different time zones, which, in turn, was not understood by their local management, and for this reason, they often had more autonomy than members of a traditional team.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson, LaFastow, 1989, p. 109) is a characteristic element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can make a difference when all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organisation.
As a result, the action of an organization working together to overcome a barrier may lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership needs to create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach high performance.
In the investigation of consciousness, neurobiological data provide direct evidence for a theoretical approach, thus narrowing the field of research and making it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, traumas, wounds and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies is making it possible to see and probe brain structures and functions that have never been seen before.
It provides a wealth of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes of our minds.
Although AI may sound like science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and cognitive adaptation of a machine.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer determinations and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things come in a variety of formats, and they focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
As built into many home computer and video game software applications, AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
School trips are an important part of any learning experience, and teachers often like to take students to places where bus travel is not possible.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips, where students can sit in their classrooms to see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or marvel at beautiful art.
Virtually sharing a field trip is a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol, and every year they rebuild that website, but keep the old versions online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also improve students' writing. While students often start writing on their blogs with lazy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical, the blogger began to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
"And blogging ""forces students to acquire more practical knowledge about the world around them"." Having to satisfy an audience's interest motivates students to be competent and interesting (Toto, 2004)".
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning well beyond a typical school day.
"Optimal use of blogs ""enables students to become more analytical and critical; by responding dynamically to Internet tools, students can define their positions in the context of others' articles and form their own views on individual arguments (Oravec, 2002)".
Ottawa is Canada's attractive, bilingual capital and features an array of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north, the scenic beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These and other factors highlight Ontario as the Canadian province that outsiders consider inescapable.
In the north, large areas are sparse, some uninhabited desert.
Here's a surprising demographic comparison: There are more African Americans in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located off the eastern coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is the largest and a wildlife continent in its own right.
Most of the small islands are independent countries, or associated with France, known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also spread Islam to many lands, especially to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the first route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is advisable for all female passengers to say they are married, regardless of whether they are actually married.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (which does not have to be expensive).
Women need to recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and that things like following and holding hands are not uncommon.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
In the 10th century BCE, the modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen, and subsequently used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids under the name of Anfa.
Only to abandon it following the 1755 earthquake, the Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru el-Badiya, the Spanish traders renamed it Casablanca, and established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the cheapest places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as Moroccan cookware, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and toys, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002 the city of Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano that blanketed most of the city streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma will be studied to try to understand the problems in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for Africa's most cost-effective mountain gorilla tracking and climbing of the Nyiragongo volcano.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get to Goma. The standard (local) fare is ~500 Congolese francs for this short distance.
"Because of the difficulty of reaching it, the word ""Timbuktu"" was used as an adjective to describe exotic and distant lands".
Although Thimphu is now a poor city, it is a popular tourist attraction and has an airport.
It was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990 because of the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main locations for Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabic flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeastern part of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, the southern border being the Crocodile River.
The park is spread over an area of 19,500 km2 divided into 14 ecozones to protect various wildlife.
It is one of the major attractions in South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African national parks (SAN parks).
Like all South African national parks, the park has daily maintenance and an entrance fee.
It may be beneficial to purchase a wildcard that gives access to some or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a major attraction for many tourists.
The line of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is called a glowing bar chart, which is caused by the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon Bay on the opposite side.
Much of the urban development on Hong Kong Island has been concentrated on reclaimed land along the north shore.
The site was owned by British colonialists, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
One of the world's largest coastal wetlands, the Sundarbans extends 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans region has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian part of the forest is known as Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the immense forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2 of which one third is covered by water.
A wildlife sanctuary since 1966, the Sunderbans is now home to an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 leopard geese.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, however most, especially those heading east to Jakhar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to book tickets a few days in advance as inter-district buses are often crowded.
Most districts had small Japanese coaster buses, which were comfortable and sturdy.
Share taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby destinations, especially to places like Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oiapoque River connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and the city of Saint Georges de Loiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, it is 378 metres long, and has two narrow passages 3.50 metres wide.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 metres (49 ft). Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in eastern Paraguay, living partly as nomadic hunters and partly as subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was home to non-indigenous tribal groups such as the Guay Curú and the Payagua, whose means of survival were hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the ""Giant Province of the Indies"", was born as a result of the clashes of the invading Spanish conquerors with the native indigenous groups".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve its indigenous character and way of life.
Argentina has one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest game of the year is held at the Polo Fields in Las Cañitas in December.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be found here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), worth 1 British Pound (GBP).
Money transfers can be made at the island's only bank, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, often accompanied by Stanley credit cards and United States dollars.
Islands in the Border region may not accept credit cards but may take British and United States currency; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is acceptable.
It is impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo belongs to the Mitochondrial region, during the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Autumn is enchantingly cold: temperatures can drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make us feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no distinct ""rainy"" or ""dry"" seasons: the amount of precipitation is approximately constant throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park can be seen by humans, wildlife is wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend a distance of at least 100 yards [100 m] from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from other predators!
Although seemingly docile, almost all large animals, including bison, antelope, deer, and bears, are capable of attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because of poor distancing. These animals are large, aggressive, and dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking a lot of smelly food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of the infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the U.S., and Britain refused to leave.
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk, and about 200 American and German lives were lost.
As part of the movement for independence, a peaceful meeting of the Maoist movement met in the city and resulted in the assassination of Paramount Chief Tapu Tamesese Lilofi III.
Intertwined with two harbours, Auckland has a number of beaches. The most popular of these are in three areas.
The North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbour district) are a large stretch of coastline on the Pacific Ocean, from Davenport in the north to South Beach in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitematā Harbour on the outskirts of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes busy family beaches with a good range of shops along the shore.
"The main local beer is ' No. 1', which is not a blended beer, but a cheerful and refreshing one. The other local beer is called ""Manna""".
There are plenty of French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be best.
Tap water in the area is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're scared, it's not hard to find bottled water.
For Australians, the concept of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. Short black is 'espresso', cappuccino is whipped cream (not foil), and tea is poured without milk.
Hot chocolate is made according to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
Several trips are made to the reef throughout the year, resulting in rare injuries on the reef.
Continue to follow advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and riverbanks from October to April in the north of 1770. They are occasionally seen outside this time.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks will swim away because they are afraid of humans.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their primary habitat being river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind because they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other accommodation such as camping grounds through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and sometimes offer packages that combine flight and hotel accommodation.
They may be able to keep your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or gather alternative documentation (e.g. visa) for your destination.
However, any changes or requests must first be communicated through the travel agent rather than directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of people who come to hear concerts decide to camp on site, as they feel it is necessary for the completeness of the experience.
If you want to be close to the participating event, you will need to arrive early to get a campsite near the concert.
Even if the music on the main stages is over, remember that in some parts of the festival the music will continue to play late into the night.
At some festivals, there are special campsites for families with small children.
If crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as those most affected can make frightening noises when passing through the ice.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Visa requirements do not apply to cruise passengers (check terms).
Casinos make many attempts to maximize time and money spent by guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests happy and stay.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served. However, drinking imposes priorities, and all good gamblers know the importance of not getting drunk.
Snow, ice, and freezing temperatures should be considered when driving in high latitudes or in valleys.
On roads covered with ice and snow, there is less friction, and you cannot drive as well as on paved roads.
In a blizzard, enough snow falls to trap you in one place in a very short time.
Ice on the windows of vehicles or snow falling or hitting them can reduce visibility.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari refers to an overland journey to see spectacular African wildlife, especially in the grasslands.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to reach close to cars, and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards occasionally escape, and you can get a good look at them with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a ""bush walk"", ""hiking safari"" or ""walking"") involves hiking that takes a few hours or several days".
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues in Japan.
Having hosted the Games in 1964, Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted 2 Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, the coronavirus-based cancellation policies will not affect July 2020, the time the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with a standard ticket costing ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes will help them dry. Many hotels will lend you an iron and an ironing board, even if no one is in the room.
If you can't find an iron, or don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to make the fabric too hot (this can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases burn).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective than others against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes many minutes.
Filters vary in their functionality, so if you take care of yourself, buy your water from a reliable company in a sealed bottle.
Because they are unfamiliar even with their own territories, travelers may encounter insects.
Insects can contaminate food, cause discomfort and, in extreme cases, allergic reactions, spread toxins, and spread infection.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that attack or kill people are not generally known as pests.
Duty free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods from certain places without paying taxes and duties.
Many of their writers were major influences on the news parody shows of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont creates some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which traverses isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not a regular driver on country roads, beware: There will be hills, inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than those of the preceding and following sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h). It is more important than ever to strictly follow them.
Surprisingly, mobile phone service is stronger here than in many other areas along the route, such as The Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good. The pastries in Bavaria are as varied as those in their southern neighbor, Austria.
Since pastries are made with apples all year round, fruit pastries are common, and cherries and plum fruits make their presence known in summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. The beloved cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small and tasty pastries, try what is called Berliner, Fankuchen or Krappfen in each region.
Curry is a dish prepared using herbs and spices, sometimes with meat or vegetables added.
"A curry can be either ""dry"" or ""wet"" depending on the amount of broth".
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, curry is usually made with yogurt; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of local dishes found throughout the country.
However, when used without additional qualifiers, the term refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Features of Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, are a selection of quite delicious dishes. The main Javanese cuisines are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially their coconut sugar), and various spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's legs that hang down either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but there may be safety concerns as the rider's legs can become trapped in them.
If the rider has been thrown from the horse, but still has a leg, they can be dragged. To reduce this risk, many safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear boots with heels, loose soles, and tight-fitting soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall off the leather side if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - Known as the Yosemite of South America, Chile's unique climbing destination is home to a variety of large granite forts and sheer cliffs.
Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes in its endless lower reaches.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard around your feet.
"Skiing, sometimes referred to as ""ski bumps"", is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts planning entire vacations around skiing in a particular location".
The concept of skiing is very old - in cave paintings dating back to 5000 BC, a skier is depicted!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, with the first recreational ski club being established by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Skier backpacking: This process is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but generally does not include, alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter of which is done on steeper terrain and requires thicker skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you can cover more distance than walking - but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on well-equipped tracks.
Although relatively small, Europe is a continent with many independent countries. In normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries will require you to go through visa application and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen Zone, however, operates as 1 country in this respect.
As long as you live in the area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member state, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies consider items more than 100 years old to be antiques.
There are geographical differences in the definition, such as regions such as North America may have lower age limits than Europe.
Handicrafts are often defined as antiques, even if they are more innovative than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sami engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but relied on fishing, hunting, etc., and used reindeer mostly for hauling loads.
Today, many Sami work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi and the Sami area.
"Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romanians, the word ""gypsy"" is often considered offensive due to its exposure to negative stereotypes and misconceptions of the Romanian people".
If the country you are going to visit is subject to a travel advisory, it may affect your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
You may also wish to consult the advice of other governments, but such advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are merely a summary of the political situation in a country.
Compared to the detail available elsewhere, the observations presented are general, very simple, and often careless.
Severe weather is a general term for hazardous weather phenomena with the potential for damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world. There are different types depending on geography, topography, and weather conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires form, while thunderstorms, storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes are the results of extreme weather.
Local and seasonal extreme weather events include blizzards, hailstorms, ice storms and hailstorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of extreme weather conditions in the places they plan to visit, as it affects their travel plans.
Those planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should undergo formal training.
An Internet search for 'hostile environment course' will probably return the address of a local company.
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in great detail along with practical experience.
