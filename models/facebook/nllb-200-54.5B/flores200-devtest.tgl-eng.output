Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but it provides details not usually provided by fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage is chestnut brown above with white or carotenoid underparts.
The discovery has also provided insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a fine shaft, called a rachis, but had other feather characteristics "barbs and barbules" the researchers reasoned that the rachis was probably more recent in evolution than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the example shows that it is the feather of an adult dinosaur and not the inner and thin feathers of a chick.
The researchers suggest that, although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not chick plumage.

Much of the work done was theoretical, but the program was written to encourage observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect predicted by the team would be caused by the immense force between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth, causing the waters of the oceans to expand and contract, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have also come to the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter affects the same matter.
According to this theory the bulk of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of limbo, and is made up of countless tiny particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, placing a pre-printed piece of paper stating their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the list of qualified voters.
The French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures.
Beginning in 1988, ballot boxes must be clearly visible to voters and observers to show that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the poll and that no envelopes have been added except those of properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car struck it, no one was hurt.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The street where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while members of the emergency team pulled the driver out of his red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred back to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in Ediburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
He was detained while awaiting arraignment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may have been obscured because his photograph was widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but the Scottish justice system has taken a different approach and the courts have taken the view that the publication of photographs has the potential to be discriminatory.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists seem to walk a fine line when publishing photographs etc. of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of all prosecutions, indicated to journalists that no further comment would be made until at least the arraignment.
The document, as revealed, refers to a border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Other topics considered included the future status of Jerusalem, which was sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the maintenance of a military presence in the valley for ten years when an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control trial are carefully supervised by the rangers, as the trial is monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the NPWS Interim Director of Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the new Provisional Council (CEP) made up of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the CEP as part of preparations to take the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-administration protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due in 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of a faulty iPod were reported, causing six fires in all and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) says it is aware of 27 previous accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "deeply regrettable".
The Mariana earthquake occurred at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said no casualties were reported in the country.
Also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a Tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman kidnapped Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and worked in the medical field.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began investigating early labor pains in her spare time.
His research shows that when a hormone is administered it can accelerate the maturation of a baby's lungs in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' that recorded the flight on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by fellow poets.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of the Peak. My first ruler. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Just as unique as she was. Brave woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated that "Luna is as weird as I am...maybe more...I love her and miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Among 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic has grown 8 percentage points since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, desiring Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At either end of the spectrum, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic soon, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his performances raised questions about his fitness.
He could not take the drugs needed to ease the pain he felt because they were banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been responsible for delivering water to earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists want to understand how the planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the news reports "political gimmicks and nonsense".
He is suspected of running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided and surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on site.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the match could be forced behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports on the development of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report new species have undergone evolution in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer, due to interbreeding between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be twisted and twisted. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin, glued to another metal, and so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It's called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice varies in color according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ion (the H in pH) in the analyzed chemical.
Hydrogen atoms consist of only one proton separated from its electron, and the separate hydrogen ion is commonly called a proton.
Mix the two dry powders together and then, using clean, wet hands, roll them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, making them feel weird and forming a skinlike film.
The ancient cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Traces of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and transmits it back down almost instantly.
Space satellites are launched by rockets. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere bends some of our visible light.
It takes a large rocket 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is give us easier and faster transportation.
It gave us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Following them are many more medium-sized cats that devour prey ranging in size from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Eventually, many small cats (including stray cats) eat more and more small prey such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is having a corresponding activity or a special activity to avoid competition from each cat.
Lions are the friendliest of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Women were often closely related to one another, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very aggressive toward their prey.
An all-round athlete, the tiger could climb (though not very well), swim, leap great distances and pull five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of a tiger is not as loud as that of a lion, but it is more like a series of hissing, shouting words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rats and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than this.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by scent, sniffing out their presence on the ground.
Able to see clearly in the dark with night vision, as well as to move stealthily, ocelots catch their prey by adapting to their environment and then grabbing their prey.
If a small group of living things (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which they came (such as if they move to a mountainous area or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a place different from where they came from.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be strong competitors than they previously needed.
Nothing has changed in the original population, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look more and more different from another population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be classified as the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon-dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants convert sunlight into food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Almost all the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, no animals can live.
The mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws have 70 sharp teeth, including the extra row above its mouth, meaning that no one can escape its clutches.
We cannot be sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although many of their dishes are familiar to us, the Romans also had their strange or unusual banquet foods, including pigweed, peacock feathers, snails, and a species of rat called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor man and the woman ate sitting on chairs, the rich man preferred to have banquets together where they would sit cross-legged while eating.
Ancient Roman diets may not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods, which was viewed as the god's house.
People would bring offerings to the gods and the priests would try to care for the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house became less important.
Much of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open spaces facing the street.
The land of Canaan had few forests, so timber was expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In the lengthy Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled farther west, he saw Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever he discovered, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian,' there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you may imagine that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one can be certain of its authorship, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (it measures 29Â3⁄4 inches by 24Â1⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Hence, the brief note may have been inserted merely as a footnote.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated Northern France, but its south was still not free.
It was under the control of the French "Vichy". These were people from France who had allied themselves with the Germans in 1940 and had become an ally of the occupiers rather than an enemy of them.
On 15 August 1940, the allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way back to Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a very large group of people who live and feel together, a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and is also somewhat indicative of the size of a society.
City-states are the beginning of nations. Civilizational culture implies the passing of knowledge across many generations, a lasting cultural footprint and equitable distribution.
Secondary cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - Congress as its exclusive organ - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power whatsoever to levy taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, it relies on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Nor does it have the power to nullify tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended and the states did not take the central government seriously so their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team is the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
The country of Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's group of islands, Japan is often called the "archipelago" because of its geographical location.
Taiwan's origins go back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Pichu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common photographic format for still images is 35 mm, which became the primary film size at the end of the analog film era.
This is still done today, but more importantly digital camera image sensor formats have inherited its aspect ratio.
The 35 mm format is in fact, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) approximate or equal this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple guide that creates vibrancy while maintaining a level of order in a photograph.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the basic principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and church funds are there for that particular purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being met.
Soon after hostilities broke out, Britain instituted a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital supplies for the military and civilians, although this barricade violated generally accepted international law codified as a system by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the rest of the ocean, causing danger even to neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing mood of most peoples and countries was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept employment with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his former job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different eras; each period of China or each family in power was a specific dynasty.
Between each dynasty was also a period of fragmented provinces, the most notable of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, fierce warfare raged between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died competing for the highest position in the luxurious palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belonged to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution jobs were opened to all male applicants giving the most ambitious and successful a chance to succeed.
The same can be said of the military because instead of rank being based on class, army ranks are now based on military prowess.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. He often went to the cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for his meditation.
the cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Located atop one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not always easy to find them, even if someone knows that they exist.
There was nothing to see except the clear blue sky and the surrounding mountains, and inside the cave, you could see and hear only a small part of the world.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramid structures built to honor the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead has many pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), many small mounds, many temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, mounds, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward sloping" mark looks like a V and the "downward sloping" mark resembles a staple or a square without a bottom.
Upward means you should start at the tip and push the proboscis in, and downward means you should start at the frog (where your hand is holding the proboscis) and pull the proboscis out.
The upstroke often produces a softer sound, while the downstroke is louder and more insistent.
Feel free to write your own marks in pencil, but note that printed digestive marks are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The King and Queen were forced to leave the windows of their carriage wide open because of the mob.
On one occasion a member of the crowd waved the head of the head of the king's guards who had been executed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in its occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to finance a large part of the expenses and the interest on bonds sold in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks.
Of course, the surplus profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main advantage of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must know the context that prompted the formation of the order.
The period in which the events take place is often called the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a very wide range of ideas in practice, from technological drive or technological necessity to the precise understanding that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a trajectory beyond cultural or political power, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are natural, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it might be said that the automobile is the driving force behind the making of roads.
However, the national road network would not be a profitable enterprise for just a few vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The ownership of more cars leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which has led to the invention of new health-care techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography evolved, and these, being geographically appropriate, were preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the way that Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its recognition as a center of prosperity began in 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century due to the fact that the Christian conquerors or Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were more highly valued than what the Byzantine market could provide.
It was during this period that the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at the height of its popularity in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Nevertheless, because of bulky means of communication, western fashions can be set back 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages western Europe began to develop their own styles. One of the biggest advances of the period as a result of the crusades was that people began to use buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Biodynamic agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses preserved seeds native to the eco-region along with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bind together like-minded people who feel marginalized by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be diverse due to the age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the value of socialization is to base a few unfavorable situations on children who were not taught good manners by adults as they grew up through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Some feral children have previously been confined by humans (often their own parents); in other cases this abandonment of the child is due to the parents' denial of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who have limited contact with people from an early age may first experience severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the forest alone.
When fully raised by animals, the feral child displays behaviors (according to physical limitations) that are almost identical to those displayed by the domesticated animal, such as fear or coldness toward humans.
While project-based learning should facilitate and make learning interesting, structured support does more than this.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to individuals going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real. That is, a teacher is a form of scaffold as is Clippy from Microsoft Office.
Virtual support frameworks are built into the software and are intended to question, hint, and illustrate procedures that may have been difficult for the student to deal with on their own.
Children are placed in the Home for so many different reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they are there.
We considered the Orphanages to be a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, continuing education, and reliable health care.
The orphanage was to provide for all the needs that were lacking in the former home from which they had been taken.
The Internet has integrated elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet make way for further forms of uses and gratifications techniques.
For example, "studying" and "socialising" have been suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audiences' reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in deciphering tiny expressions, facial movements that occur in just a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting his small expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess loyalty correctly.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior might be similar in animals such as domesticated dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of variation currently in use.
Segregation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino-acid requirements from plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources to obtain are the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but they provide an abundance of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savannah monkeys do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself changing the clock during your sleep, it may be placed on the opposite side of your room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms call for drinking plenty of water (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which stimulates one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The less stress, the more positive the life force that exists. Each person has the potential to find complete peace and security.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that prevents this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extended by the mahayana path of love and by the myriad techniques derived from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all lovers.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of emptiness) is awakened in the form of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. By visualizing various deities in the mind, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and a sense of enlightenment is created.
Germany became the enemy of all during World War 2, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war conflicts in system, process and culture led to disagreement between the countries.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It will last for the next 40 years and will actually be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is the best method of all for moving large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, blocking your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the last notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, when the Americans attempted to ferry men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have conquered Britain as it had most of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were often placed in herds that roamed the mountains or other pastures, often tended by shepherds who were often children or adolescents, similar to the better-known shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th Century.
Even though the carts were made of parallel wooden planks, this allowed the horses to pull them faster and to pull heavier loads than on slightly rougher roads.
Trusses were used early to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that rails would be more efficient if they had a narrow piece of steel on top.
This practice became widespread, but steel caused the wooden wheels of chariots to become more common.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The first known transport was walking where humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning erect man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as was natural.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been able to walk on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more sustainably, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in some way.
This is similar to treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we want only a temporary solution, then we must find the root of the problems and stop them from working.
Suffice it to say that mankind's scientific and technological advances have changed the world dramatically, and problems have been made worse by overpopulation and the high cost of living.
After Congress approved it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap posters".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not believe that they were dinosaurs because they had feathers and could fly.
But there are so many things about birds that are still similar to dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the control of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, e.g. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, when using computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally sufficient to preclude immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic chemicals in the home.
Check the label for specific instructions for the first-line treatment for that particular poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is an allusion to the ancient knowledge of the Suras, which are insects well adapted for human habitation.
Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs both depend for a long time on their hosts after they are born, adapting to live in the nest or hive of their host.
Throughout the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), considered the leading neurological disorder among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to have a baby.
A couple may decide to give their baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to learn how the world works by means of the scientific method, which, in fact, guides most scientific research.
Not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers turned their attention to classical texts and, in particular, to the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, are widely accepted.
With the ensuing decline of Greek knowledge, the West found itself far from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms seen in body structure and behavior are highly dependent on what is happening inside their bodies and on their production by the biological clock.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not simply responses to external seasonal cues, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue a period of freewheeling cycling even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments labeling either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects based on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are cells for sexual reproduction.
Mutations in only the cells of the germ line can be passed on to offspring, whereas mutations anywhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including the flora and fauna of the forest.
Examples of actual activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird-watching, and visiting parks and learning about the environment.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the Bornean orangutans.
Every day, people leave the country's small towns by car to go to their places of employment and pass by others whose place of employment is where they came from.
In this dynamic transportation commute all people are in some way connected to, and support, a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this vast carbon economy has removed the ecological system (biosphere) from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everybody participates in the community and uses the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same degree of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are there such complaints about transportation systems, why do they break down every day? Are transportation engineers really incompetent? Or is something more important going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, analyzing traffic flow is not easy because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to stay within a fixed range; thus, traffic flow is also constant and can be mathematically estimated.
To better visualize traffic flow, associations have been made between three basic properties: (1) flow, (2) weight, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and management of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly enabled them to cover their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of having the ability to fold their wings along with the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people believed he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and possibly other stars).
This seems significant, because it doesn't really feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's second-longest and largest river, carrying more than eight times as much water as the next-largest river.
The Amazon is also the World's widest river, at times being six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building with stone did not stop until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in their size and in the technical sophistication of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its law and official communications.
Italian was also the everyday language of most people working in the state while Latin was often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since they can all be found in nature in native forms and are easily mined with primitive equipment.
Greek philosopher Aristotle thought that all matter was composed of a combination of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
More closely related to this were the four states of matter (in this order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also postulated that these undergo chemical reactions to form what we see.
Alloys are usually mixtures of two or more metals. Keep in mind that many elements in the periodic table and some of them are also metals (such as calcium and potassium) and can be mixed with other metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. Everything is made up of little things called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions upon trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Hence, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as new forms of writing appeared, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and use.
People now type messages on computer screens, never needing to approach the keyboard.
Only when something newer came along did a person know what could happen at the keyboard.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy must combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Perhaps like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, nuclear fission releases more of that energy.
Some atoms are those with unbalanced numbers of protons and neutrons which means that they tend to disappear when there are few or no matching numbers of protons and neutrons.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the near side and 100 km thick at the far side.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker below the highlands.
There may be more maria in the visible part of the world because the earth's crust is thinner. It is easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories center on finding what will motivate people or capture their attention.
These theories imply that people have some particular needs and/or desires that they embrace as they age.
These theories are about what drives some people to desire what they do and what factors in their environment drive them to do or not to do things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an anonymous individual who feels he must change everything the group does and have it done to him.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This attitude often results in misunderstandings between leaders and other team members.
Virtual groups are also held to the same standards of well-being as regular groups, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual group often serve as the point of contact for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of the general group because their groups may meet according to different time zones that their local administration may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a distinctive feature of the virtual group.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team assigns standards to each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of learning organization building? One goal for actively implementing learning organization concepts is innovation.
If all resources are used effectively throughout an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can be expressed.
As a result, the process of the organization working together to overcome an obstacle may lead to a new innovative process to service the customer's need.
Before there can be an organization of innovators, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and learning as an organization.
Anghel (2006), explains the Continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical way of investigating learning ability. It therefore limits the field of research and makes it more precise.
Scientists' research supports the connection between brain pathology and behavior.
It has been known for a very long time that various types of brain damage, traumatic experiences, injuries, and bizarre tumors can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The proliferation of new technologies has enabled us to see and examine structures and processes in the brain that were previously unseen.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material with which to build simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, which is about the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
AI research involves building machines that will automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Among the tasks of AI are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer surveys and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as is the case with software applications for many home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Teachers often like to take their students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution through virtual educational tours. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit the aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing an educational trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with underprivileged classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol, every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help to improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, it is usually modified by the presence of readers.
Since students are often the most criticized by viewers, the blogger started improving her writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to be smarter about the world around them". The need to provide audience interest prompts students to be witty and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a way to stimulate collaboration, and encourages students to continue learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can enable students to be more critical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can identify their positions in the context of what others have written as well as formulate their own views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's exciting, bilingual capital and features many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the far south is Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and many more characterize Ontario as what outsiders might consider Canadian.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated and some are almost deserted.
For a population comparison that surprised many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and it can be considered a continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it became very important in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The Sahel borders the region to the north, and to the south and west is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any women traveling say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It may also help to wear a ring (as long as it does not look too expensive.)
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they may view as harassment and that it is normal to be followed, touched on the arm, and so forth.
Be firm in saying no to boys, and don't be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, it's still not acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and by the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all kinds of pipes, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo at its easternmost border with Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated when lahars from the Nyiragongo volcano blocked most of the town's roads, especially in the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be explored to understand the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest tracking of Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The average (local) fare is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Along with its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poverty-stricken village, although its reputation makes it a popular tourist destination, and it has an airstrip.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main destinations visited by Henry Louis Gates in his PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is different from all other cities in the country, as it is more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 kmÂ2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a variety of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the pride of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there is a fee for day-to-day conservation and park admission.
It may also be worthwhile for a person to purchase a Forest Card, which gives access to any of South Africa's select parks or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and the area many tourists recognize as a major destination.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a shimmering bar chart made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Much of the development of Hong Kong Island's cities has been in the dense patch of reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is the area that the British conquerors claimed as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into Bangladesh and Indian provinces from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest that is in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining vestiges of the mighty forests that once covered the Ganga plains.
The Sundarbans covers 3,850 km2, of which one-third is submerged wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 409 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (NU 150) and Punakha (NU 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two aisles 3.50 meters wide.
The height of the space under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when construction of the Brazilian customs inspection stations will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for their livelihood.
The Chaco region became home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the clash between Spanish conquistadores and groups of indigenous tribes.
The Spanish began a period of conquest that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain many of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the Las Cañitas polo field.
Smaller tournaments and battles can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) whose value is equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank located in Stanley opposite the Western FIC store.
British pounds are widely accepted throughout the islands and Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted as well.
On outlying islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be available; check in advance with the owners to find out what is a good method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located in the south of Ecuador, it experiences the Northern Hemisphere's summer and winter solstices.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures of over 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but air and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no particular "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to seeing humans, the wild animals are nevertheless fierce and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials say, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife!
No matter how gentle they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
These animals are large, fierce, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a famous naval ceasefire in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is sandwiched between two harbors.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these are sandy beaches where it is safe to wade, most with shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket Mission Bay and St Heliers neighbourhoods of Central Auckland.
These were once busy family beaches with a good array of shops lining the waterfront.
The main local beer is 'Numero Uno', it is not a complicated beer, if not pleasant and refreshing.
Many French wines can be purchased, but New Zealand and Australian wines may fare better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. The short black is 'espresso', the cappuccino includes a high layer of cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is a Belgian specialty. Fruit juice drinks are expensive but delicious.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries from any cause related to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and heed safety warnings.
Dikya appear near the coasts and near the mouths of rivers from October to April in the north of 1770.[citation needed] They are occasionally seen outside these seasons.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively inhabit the ocean, their main habitat being the river estuaries north from Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to stay once they arrive at the destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodations, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even packages that combine flight and hotel.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to study the offer or to take care of other paperwork for your trip (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be made in advance to the travel agency representative and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, get there early to get accommodations near the music.
Keep in mind that even after the music on the main stages has ended, there may be parts of the ceremony that will continue late into the night.
Some festivals have designated campsites for families with small children.
When visiting the North Baltic each winter, check the location of the lodging house, as going out on the ice can cause some serious noise for those deliberately affected.
Sea trips to Saint Petersburg require spending time in the city. Travelers are exempt from visa requirements (see rules).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to make the most of the time and money spent by visitors.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment, to keep the guests feeling good, and to keep them there.
Some places offer free alcohol. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or on mountain roads should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, there is less friction and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow to stop you can fall in a fraction of the time.
The ability to see falling or blowing snow or condensation or ice through car windows may also be limited.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is not disturbed all year round.
Wildlife viewing or safaris are perhaps Africa's greatest tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a journey overland to view the spectacular wildlife of Africa, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars and ordinary equipment can allow good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are occasionally shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "trekking") involves hiking, either for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Several events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you have already booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend beyond July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with standard tickets costing ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be sat on, even if they are not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you do not want to wear ironed stockings, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (this can cause clothing to shrink, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are various methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in others, more than a minute is needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you too have concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter exotic pests in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more serious cases cause allergic reactions, spread germs, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly sicken or kill people, are not usually transmitted as pests.
Duty free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods free of taxes at certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable sums of money, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
The stretch of road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through remote woodland.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: the terrain is steep, narrow, and twisty.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than the preceding and following sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is more important than not.
Surprisingly, however, mobile-phone service is stronger here than along many other routes, e.g. the Pennsylvania Woods.
German pastries are delicious, and in Bavaria, they are as delicate and varied as in its neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, apples are baked into pastries year-round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer season.
Many German bread products also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you like some small but tender breads, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on what they are called regionally.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the landlocked regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, gata is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers the wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term usually means the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a row of simply seasoned dishes, the dominant Javanese seasoning favouring peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various low spices.
The stirrups on each side of the horse provide support for the rider's legs.
They provide more stability for the rider but can be a safety concern because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse runs. To reduce the risk, some precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, spongy soles.
Next, some horses, particularly English horses, have safety bars that allow the steering collar to fall from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamí Valley - the top climbing area in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, and with various large granite walls and slopes.
The peaks include breathtaking views from the summits. Climbers from different parts of the world continue to establish new routes amid the endless potential of its walls.
Ice sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve rapid descent over icy terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major activity when traveling with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning entire vacations centered on skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but generally not used with alpine styles of hiking or mountaineering on skis, as the latter are done on steep terrain and require stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover somewhat greater distances than walking - but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross- country skiing without a heavy backpack on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travel to many countries means having to go through visa application and passport control several times.
The Schengen zone operates however much like a country in this respect.
While you are in this zone, you can cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately in each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies define products more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies by geography, where the length of the year may be shorter in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be interpreted as antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture surrounding this occupation is also important to many who have other occupations.
Even traditionally, although not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, reindeer ownership was mostly as working animals.
Today, many Sámi are employed in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sámi, the Sámi area.
Although it is widely used, especially by non-Romanies, the word "Hitano" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are going to is subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your cancellation of the trip may be effective.
You can also consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different experiences than Europeans or Arabs.
The alerts provide only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often shallow, general, and simplistic compared with the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it can take many forms, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, torrential rains, and wildfires are types and effects of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and typhoons.
Regional and seasonal severe weather including blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be alert to the risk of severe weather affecting their area as it may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An Internet search for 'Hateful Environment Course' will likely turn up the address of a local company.
A course will often cover all the issues discussed here in more detail, often with practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2-5 days and includes games, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and journals dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning sex-change operations abroad should make sure that they carry valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports stating the gender not stated (X) or documents altered to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as widely.
Checks at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001, era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to go through scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the backwash from waves breaking on a beach, usually a reef or similar.
Underwater topology causes the return flow to be concentrated in some deeper part, and fast water flow can be generated there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back will be no more difficult than normal.
Try to get to a place where you will not be swept away again or, depending on your abilities and if you have been spotted, you may want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock comes earlier than culture shock (it has fewer stages of pulutgata), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Sometimes travelers who adapt quickly to a new culture find it even harder to reestablish contact with their native culture.
When you return to your home country after living abroad, you have become accustomed to a new culture and have lost some of your native habits.
When you first arrive in a new country, people are likely to be patient and understanding, realizing that traveling to a new land involves some adjustments.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers going home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the area's greatest attractions for children.
You can view the pyramids in the dark and view them quietly before the show begins.
The story of sound and light is like that of a storybook.
The Sphinx became the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown in the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island which is inhabited by Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the steep crater of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Equator, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Tangway Mountains here merge into the plateau, and then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, which reaches a height of 4892 m Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, where there is no cell-phone coverage, your only option is a satellite phone.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, since you have to be outdoors and have a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships for sea travel including cruise ships, and for journeys requiring data acquisition and calling.
The local telephone service provider is expected to be able to provide further information on how to contact this service.
An increasingly popular travel option for those planning vacations is to travel and learn.
It is extremely popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a gap year before entering college, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad may actually improve your chances of transferring to higher education in your home country.
There will usually be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, located in lakes and archipelagos along the coast.
On archipelagos and lakes you will not always need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos off the continent's coast and the largest lakes are certainly big enough for any yacht, small boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Almost all exotic Baltic Cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for two full days while returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore by boat for sightseeing you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the area is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and fetishes that so many people have.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens on a flight may help overcome fears based on the unknown or lack of control.
Freight forwarders are paid handsomely for delivering items quickly. Often, time is of the essence for business documents, merchandise or parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and smaller companies have problems.
When they send goods by air freight, some routes may take several days to clear unloading and customs.
The only way to speed up the process is to send them as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to be carried unaccompanied, and that is where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first or business class is to pay for the privilege with a thick wad of cash (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: judging by standards, you can expect to pay up to four times the standard economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there is no reason to look further for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that certain groups of travelers are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, disagreement led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member nation.
Economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been reestablished despite failed political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city with a population of 3.7 million, the second-largest seaport after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, prosperous, and bustling commercial center, situated around a large seashore and surrounded by mountains.
Broad avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers are covered with traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets, and old Muslim mosques and churches of other religions, although the city has an atmosphere more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of HaldarsvÃ­k offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on some mounds.
Touring the attraction takes about half an hour.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra that became known to foreigners after a grandiose account of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north is a visit to the great Sanctuary of the Virgin of Fatima, a site of Marian apparitions known throughout the world.
Please remember that you are in fact visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site of almost incalculable significance to much of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who outlived their time here, and many others who had loved ones killed or died from the hardships of working here, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, sincerity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not defile the area by destroying structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost all know Spanish.
However, almost all signs are written only in Catalan because it is set by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often a mistaken stereotype, the best way to fit in in Paris is still to show good manners, acting as if you were "bien élevé" (well brought up).
The rude manners of Parisians would quickly disappear if you were to show simple courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes national park is heavily forested, mostly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a diverse range of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and different altitude levels.
The area will also be home to a great variety of animals and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more common species
While visiting monasteries, women were required to wear skirts that covered the knees and should also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide wrappings for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men had to wear trousers that covered the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the entrance supply but the clothes are not washed after each use so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Mojarcan cuisine, as in similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple popular meal, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and whatever seasonings are available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, besides the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and nouns.
It is also said to facilitate reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether the verb or the adjective is used in the noun form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means expensive, but carro means carriage.
The Persian language is somewhat easy and almost all is common grammar.
Hence, reading this introductory grammar book will help you to learn much about Persian grammar and to understand phrases better.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know some Spanish may quickly conclude that it is so similar to Portuguese that it does not need to be learned separately.
Observatories built before the modern era are often now obsolete, left as museums or places for education.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan the first cherry-blossom parties were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look best in their natural setting, so resist the urge to take just "one" specimen.
If visiting a formal garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you kicked out, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and very easy to find things to do there, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator means that you have to cope with both heat (always) and intense sunshine (when the skies are clear, less often).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Note that the bus you are thinking of taking will enter Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish community of Kiryat Arba.
Waterways away from the coast can be a good theme for a vacation.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or the Erie Canal.
They also designate routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with Christmas have been adopted by nonbelievers in Christendom and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter Sunday awake to see the sun rise.
There are various Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is likely that it was a pre-Christian Spring and Autumn ritual.
More traditional churches usually hold the Easter Vigil on the evening of Holy Saturday of the Easter weekend, when congregations usually celebrate at the stroke of midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally reached the islands did so by swimming, flying, or cooking.
The distance from the mainland made it impossible for mammals to travel, so the giant tortoises became the Galapagos' main source of food.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter you will experience the long polar night, which means that the sun does not rise.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, since the sky will be dark for about twenty-four hours.
Since areas are sparsely populated, and thus light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be accustomed to.
Jackets are the standard business attire, and employees address one another by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is vital, emphasizing group effort rather than singling out individual accomplishments.
Workers often have to get the approval of their superiors for any decisions they make, and they are expected to follow the orders of their superiors without question.
