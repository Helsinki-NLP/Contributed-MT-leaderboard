Not only does this confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already known, but the fossil provides information that cannot usually be provided, such as color and three-dimensional texture.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were dark brown above and pale or yellow underneath.
This discovery also gives a subtle understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have well-developed slender canines, called rachis, but had other characteristics of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers speculated that rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the tail of adult juveniles appears in this specimen, not the underside of a chick.
The researchers suggest that, although this was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows that these are adult feathers, not chick feathers.

This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as being potentially biased.
"Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, notes that ""journalists seem to walk a fine line if they publish photos of suspects, etc".""
The Crown Office, which has overall control of the prosecution's proceedings, has told reporters that it will not comment until an indictment is made.
The document, according to the leak, will mention a border dispute based on borders before the 1967 Middle East war, which the Palestinians want.
Other issues notably covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Following the signing of the agreement, Israel is demanding an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years while the PA agrees to such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control trial were closely monitored by rangers, as the trial was regulated and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's Hunting Program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS Executive Director of Garden Conservation and Cultural Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly was sworn into the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEC) yesterday.
This is Martel's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly was reacting to the anti-regime protests that began in October with the Commission.
Failure to hold elections after 2011 led to violent protests.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and up to four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
"Last week, MITI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 overheating incidents, which the company called ""non-critical""".
"The ministry responded to Apple's postponement of the report, calling it ""truly regrettable""".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Office of Emergency Management said no damage was reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said there was no indication of a tsunami.
Former Filipino policemen hijack a bus of Hong Kong tourists and hold them hostage in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six people are confirmed dead.
6 hostages including Filipino photographers and children as well as elderly were released first.
Photographers replaced an elderly woman as she needed to go to Jajru. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Leggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the clinic, Liggins began researching pre-mature labor in her spare time.
Their research found that if the hormone is given, the fetus's lungs develop more quickly.
"On Wednesday, government investigators recovered the ""black boxes"" of the two flight recorders, Xinhua reported".
Fellow wrestlers also paid tributes to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said that ""Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager, Luna, died between two moons. Just like her.
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels said that ""Luna was as eccentric as I was....maybe even more so....loves her and misses her.....hopefully she is in a better place"."
In a poll of 1,400 voters before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to a republic in Australia increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed in the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those who participated in the poll are of the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the height of the poll, 29 per cent of those polled believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believed Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist is due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but her complaints have cast doubt on her fitness.
The pain medication could not be taken as it is banned in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people tested the research in early February, using different types of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of organic material that could have formed water and proteins and supported life on Earth.
Scientists try to understand how planets form, especially the formation of the Earth, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing gay marriage.
"He called the rumors ""political gossip and stupidity""".
She is likely to run for the presidency in the 2016 election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, so that the air traffic controller can track the aircraft with greater accuracy and provide more accurate information to the pilot.
No new transport facilities will be introduced and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available at the ground.
The fear of lack of transport raised the possibility that the team would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the process would take much longer, due to breeding between the native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza coniorostris.
Gold can be cast into all kinds of shapes. It can also be cast into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and striped, which can be hammered or turned into a plaque.
"It could be made very thin, and applied to other metals. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called ""illuminated manuscripts""".
This chemical is called pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the strength of the hydrogen in the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms have 1 proton and 1 electron).
Make a mixture of two powders and then fill the ball with the mixture with clean and green hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will look funny and create a kind of shield.
Almost every household in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a developed sewage system.
Remains of ancient sewer systems have been found in Minoan cities of Crete and in the homes of the Greeks of Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public baths used by both men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away from you, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and sends it down immediately after.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere obscures the view and light.
A 100-foot-tall rocket is required to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
Wheels have brought tremendous changes in the world and if wheels have given us the biggest thing, it is easy and fast transportation.
He gave us trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium sized cats that eat medium sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat many small prey such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is this sense of space, each cat has a special job that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides are a group of one to three adult males, thirty females and cubs.
Sisters and daughters are a large family, with the result that women are primarily close to each other.
Prides of lions act like packs of wolves or dogs, other animals behave like lions (except other big cats), which are very deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not perfectly), swim, long jump, and plough with 5 times the strength of the strongest man.
Tigers are in the same group as lions, leopards and jaguars (Panthera). Only these four cats can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar of free voice, but like a line of very rough, loudly spoken words.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. It catches monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if possible. Any animal that the ocelot preys upon is much smaller than its own size.
Scientists think that ocelots ate and detected animals by smell, smelling where they were on the ground.
They can see well at night due to their night vision, and can also move stealthily. Ocelots blend into their surroundings and then attack and hunt prey.
When a small group of living things (small population) is separated from its main group (for example when they migrate over a mountain or river, or reach a new island from where they can not return) they die in a new environment than before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so for a new firm to become a strong competitor, it will need different features or adaptations than they needed before.
The underlying demographics have not changed in the slightest, they still need the same relevance as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they will look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, two populations of very different animals will start to look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from trees. A large part of our food comes from trees. Without trees, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared no one but other mosasaurs.
It had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth in its long jaw, and an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but its tongue would have been forked. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
Attacking any creature that entered the water, even a large dinosaur like T. rex would have been no match for it.
While much of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans have their share of strange or unusual treats that include wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women would sit and eat their meals in chairs, the rich men liked to have a meal where they would sit next to them while they ate.
Ancient Roman food may not have included food coming from the Americas to Europe or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the house of God in human form.
People brought offerings to the Lord and priests tried to fulfill the wishes of the Lord through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctum into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers were built as part of temples, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home was not of great importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life was spent in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; storerooms had open counters that could be seen from the street; stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan had relatively few forests, so timber was expensive.
The founding of Greenland was sporadic. The Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and travelled further west until he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of their discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian,' there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words, ""Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776"". This text appears written at the bottom of the document".
While no one knows who wrote it, it is known that initially, large leather paper documents (it measures 293/4 inches by 241/2 inches) were folded for storage.
So, it's possible that the notation was just added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the northern half of France, but the south was still not liberated.
"It was ruled by the ""Vichy"" French. These were the French who had signed a treaty with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fight them".
"On 15 August 1940, Allied forces launched an attack on the south of France, known as ""Operation Dragoon""".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were marching into Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civitas, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also defines the size of a society by whatever means.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. A civic culture means the passing of knowledge through many generations, a cultural heritage and impartial transmission.
Small civilizations largely disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to gain recognition as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states first formed a weak central government - the only component of which was Congress - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state officials, who were not always cooperative, to do all its work.
It also had no power to overrule tax laws and tariffs between states.
The unanimous consent of all the states was required before the article was amended and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Along with the German national football team, the Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Italians participate in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to geographically as an 'archipelago' due to the cluster of islands near Japan.
European sailors passing through Taiwan beginning in the 15th century recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in tribal grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a territory of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of 3 structures, named, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and a room with 3 windows.
Most of the buildings located fairly close to the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of still image photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but, importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35-millimeter structure is actually somewhat confusing, 36 millimeters wide times 24 millimeters high.
The ratio of these formats (dividing by twelve to get the ratio of whole numbers) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common structures (the APS family of structures, for example) are identical or very close to these shape proportions.
The much-vaunted and much-ridiculed Rule of Thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamics while maintaining the scale of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the third of the picture vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
Despite differences in language and customs, over a period of a thousand years, European states were linked by Christianity.
From the king down to the least of them, every one was filled with admiration at his beauty.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate pain and poverty, and church funds are specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for a thousand years and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of war, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
That strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies. The blockade, however, went against many international treaties dating back 2 centuries and generally accepted international laws.
To prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the sea, Britain built a tunnel in international waters, which also posed a threat to neutral ships.
With limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a spirit of pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most nations and citizens.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such conditions in the future.
In 1884, Tesla came to America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods.
There was an unstable era of divided provinces between each dynasty. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce battles were fought between nobles to gain the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying fighting for the highest seat in the grand palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from totalitarianism to democracy, nationalism, and the recognition that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, jobs became available to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true for the army as instead of army ranks being based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The crushed workers of other countries were also inspired by the French Revolution to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad had a deep interest in things that transcended this material life. He often went for meditation to a cave, which became known as the ""Hira"" on the ""Nur"" (Light) mountain".
He himself discovered natural caves that have survived the passage of time, giving a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Located on top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if one knows it exists, it's not easy to find.
Nothing can be seen except the beautiful sky above and many mountains around. Very few things of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of several massive pyramids built in honor of the pharaohs.
"In Egypt's Valley of the Dead, the Giza Plateau or ""Giza Necropolis"" (of which the largest pyramid is the most famous) contains many pyramids, many small tombs, many temples, and huge sculptures".
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and concubines.
The "upper bow" mark looks like a V and the "lower bow" looks like a staple or square with the bottom side missing.
Up means you should start at the top and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
And the upper arch usually creates a delicate sound, while the lower arch creates a stronger and more insistent sound.
You can mark around your own signs with a pencil, but remember that there are also printed bowing signs for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were chased back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
In a coach they returned to Paris and a mob surrounded the king and queen, threatening and intimidating.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep their coach windows open.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a slain royal guard at Versailles to the terrified queen.
The cost of U.S. imperialism in conquering the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime through Wall Street banking houses to pay a large part of the costs and interest on liquid bonds in the name of the Philippine government.
However, the enormous profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would establish the basic benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it's important to understand the context that led to the creation of the cult.
The period in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, traditionally dated to around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses various ideas in practice, technology-push or technological necessity in the strict sense requiring that human destiny be governed by scientific laws and the underlying logic associated with their expression in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development largely exceeds cultural or political influence, and that technology has ""effects"" on societies that are internal rather than social conditions".
For example, one may say that if there are motor cars, it is necessary to develop roads.
However, the nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new methods of manufacturing have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The collective ownership of cars also causes an increased incidence of accidents on the roads, which motivates the search for new technologies to repair physical defects and treat health.
Romanticism has broad strands of cultural fatalism, drawing from authors such as Goethe, Feucht and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, individuals shaped by geography and the customs and culture associated with that geography emerged over time and these people were better off than arbitrarily imposed laws as they were consistent with the location of society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of splendour began in about 400 BC and lasted until about 1100 BC.
Its prestige began to decline in the 12th century, largely because the jihadists returned with gifts of silks and spices worth far more than the price offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
The Byzantine civilization to the east initially heavily influenced dressing.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western European countries began to develop their own styles. One of the biggest developments of the time as a result of the movement was that people started using buttons to wear clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming which is done to produce just enough food grains to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, mostly organic, system that uses previously saved seeds from a local ecological area to increase yield with crop rotation or some other relatively simple method.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and many developing countries still practice subsistence farming.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social norms and give them an identity.
Subcultures may be specific because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of secondary cultures often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including fashions, manners, and distinctive language.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization draws attention to a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults either through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse while they were growing up.
"Such children are called ""vulnerable"" or feral. Some feral children are kept in captivity by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases the abandonment of these children was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability".
Feral children may have experienced excessive abuse or torture before escaping or being abandoned.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are said to live in the forest on their own.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the behaviour of such a feral child is almost identical (within physiological limits) to that of its animal parent, such as its fear of humans or its indifference to humans.
When project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but an aid that helps people who are having a new learning experience like using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding but the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office is also a scaffold.
The simulations are internalised into the software and they are meant to question, signal readiness and clarify processes that may be challenging for the student to focus on alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that lacks nutrition, care and education, but they do.
We understand the foster care system to be a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe housing, loving caregivers, balanced education and reliable health care.
It is believed that foster care will meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal messaging.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and content approach.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" may be suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)".
"Iggy and McCord (1998) identified that ""personal participation"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were also new motivational aspects when they were examining audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last up to a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that whether a person is lying or not can be known by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his paper The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks, hinted that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless accurate at assessing sincerity.
They also suggest that such abilities to interpret human behavior are comparable to animals such as domesticated dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
There are shuffle variations that shuffle back and forth between two sets with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino-acid requirements from available plant sources.
And failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources may be the accessible proteins in leaves and seeds but if they are not cooked they are difficult for animals like us humans to digest.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high quality proteins that contain all these amino acids.
"All things considered we should not be surprised that our own ancestors may have solved their ""protein problem"" in somewhat the same way that chimpanzees solve theirs on the savannah today".
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally awakening during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you reset the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking lots of water before bed (especially water or tea, a known diuretic), which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of stress in a person's body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive life force is present. Everyone has the capacity to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to achieving this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana cult of love and by the many practices of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It shows the way to adopt Kundalini yoga, meditation and love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and mental imagery.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the vision of various gods and goddesses, the energy channels are cleared, the energy centers of the body are activated and the knowledge consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the United States and Russia. With the end of World War II, conflicts of order, process, and culture led countries to collapse.
Two years after the war ended, former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought for real by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had been broken and the only hope of reuniting was at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were cancelled almost overnight when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish agreements, and other treaties, both unilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the seas.
The job of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and your goods, while also interfering with your enemy's ability to move their own people and their goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans moved men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, perhaps Germany would have won over Britain, because it had the rest of Europe with it.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to easily obtain milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often led by herders who were mostly children or teenagers, the most widely known term being herder. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways had only wooden parallel planks, they allowed horses to achieve greater speed and pull larger loads than the more rugged roads of the day.
Crosses were introduced very early to maintain the track. However, it was gradually realised that tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the car.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron bars were introduced.
The first known form of transport was the act of walking, humans learned to walk upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning 'standing man').
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright out of habit.
Bipedal features are found in the remains of Australopithecus dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
However, if we do not see only a temporary solution, we should try to find the root cause of the disease and treat it.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems due to overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of mankind have increased.
After approval by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlop's printing shop a few blocks away.
"Overnight 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as ""Dunlap broadsides""".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
1 was sent to George Washington on July 6, who delivered it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 documents of the Dunlap broadside are the oldest extant copies still in existence. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's still a lot of talk about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not appear immediately. Signs such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The presence of an open container of medications or household chemicals can be an excellent indicator of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific instructions of first aid for that particular poison.
Entomologists formally use the term ant for this group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient acquaintance with the monkey, a parasite on humans.
Both mosquitoes and toads are parasitic, living either in their burrows or in the host's habitat.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that child-rearing is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
The couple may choose to plan to adopt a child for themselves.
In adoption, the birth parents terminate their rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main objective of science is to determine how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not alone, experimentation can be used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations can also lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers turned to the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
For all matters of science, including psychology, Aristotle's views held sway.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself alienated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the apparent rhythms of physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endochondral cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks have self-winding pendulums that, even without an external cue, run continuously for a period of time.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They performed 2 experiments marking DNA in phages with radioactive phosphorus or proteins in phages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations Depending on the type of mutation the significance of the fraction of the genetic element affected and the affected cells can have different effects on germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the natural scenery including flora and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about ecosystems.
One example is about visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in their cars to go to their workplace and leave others whose workplace is the same place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is connected and supported by a transport system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has disrupted the biosphere from its single stable state, which has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone becomes a part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone has a complaint about the transport system.
Complaints about water quality or broken bridges are rarely heard in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems bear the brunt of such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles that are between 2 points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult, because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 1-hundred percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers drive at a relatively constant speed; therefore, the flow of traffic remains relatively constant and can be represented mathematically to some extent.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, designing and operating roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over the body.
This gives them a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and short-lived moths.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought it was true but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and other stars).
This is understandable, because he doesn't realize the Earth is spinning, what's going on?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the Earth's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, although the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed for their size and the technical superiority of their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were overwhelmed by the monuments of their ancestors that were more than a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of around 800. It is the world's smallest independent country and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times because they are found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, who was a philosopher, proved that everything is made up of a combination of these 1 to 4 elements, earth, water, air and fire.
This was similar to the four substances of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they could morph into new substances to make what we see.
Alloys consist of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also find alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. Everything is made of tiny particles called atoms.
An atom is surprisingly so small that millions of atoms could fit by the end of this sentence right now.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as new writing systems emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower place in use.
People type messages on computer screens now, never have to go near a sharpener.
It is a matter of imagination what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes up.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like taking a very heavily loaded car up a hill.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, meaning they tend to fall apart with little or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the surface.
This crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thin below the maria and thick below the heights.
There may have been more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theory focuses on what draws people's attention or what attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have some needs and/or desires that are internally repressed until they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about some people that makes them want to do what they do and what it is about their environment that makes them willing to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
"Generally, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum strives to be ""a man"" (or gal)".
This type of manager has difficulty in making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes another kind of unrecognizable person who feels like they have to change what the team is doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often creates differences between leaders and the rest of the team.
Real teams also have the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with a subtle difference.
In many cases virtual team members serve as a point of contact with their immediate physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which local management may not understand.
"The presence of a true ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFastow, 1989, p. 109) was also a unique component of the virtual team".
The ""invisible team"" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member".
Why would an institution want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up an educational institution? One of the goals of implementing institutional education concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity flourish when all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of the organisation.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new creative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an institution adopts innovation, it should create an environment of innovation through appropriate leadership and facilitate the exchange of institutional information and education.
Angel (2006) advocates adopting a continuum approach to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to direct knowledge. Thus, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The link between brain disease and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies is allowing us to see and probe structures and processes in the brain we've never seen before.
This provides a lot of information and material for building replication models that help us understand our brain processes.
Despite the connotations of science fiction, artificial intelligence is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with machine behavior, learning and adaptation to its intelligence.
Research in AI involves building machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose the customer and answer their questions as well as signature, voice and facial recognition.
Such matters have become a separate discipline, which focuses on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, being used in some home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher will like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
The technology offers solutions that include virtual field trips.Students can sit in their classrooms and see museum objects, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art.
Sharing the field trip information virtually is a great way to revisit the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina visit the state capitol every year and create a website about it, and the website is updated every year, but the old version is saved online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can help improve a student's writing. Students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually makes a difference.
Because students are often the most critical listeners, bloggers try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogging ""forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them"". Motivates students to be clever and interesting to satisfy the interests and needs of the audience (Toto, 2004)".
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn beyond the traditional school curriculum.
Appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical: by actively responding to Internet content, students can define their position in relation to the writings of others as well as outline their own perspectives on particular issues (Oreveke, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's glamorous, bilingual capital and home to superb art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the far south is Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
Large areas in the north are very sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited forest.
A population comparison that surprises people: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands lie off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands belong to independent nations or France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also carried Islam to various regions, and it became widespread in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
It is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advised that any female passenger should state that she is married, whether they are married or not.
It also helps to wear a ring (that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that what they perceive as harassment may have cultural differences and that following, holding hands, etc. are not uncommon.
Be firm about rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not the same).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century by Berber fishermen, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Moroccan Sultan and Spanish merchants named it Casablanca and established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan items such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and gigawatts, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda in the far east.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the town centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese Francs.
"With its relative accessibility, ""Timbuktu"" has been used as a metaphor for foreign, distant lands".
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
The African was one of the special wonders of the world during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders.
The city is quite unlike other cities in the country, as it has more Arabic than African influence.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
Like other South African national parks, the park has daily breeding and entrance fees.
It may also be beneficial for someone to purchase a wild card, which grants access to a selection of parks in South Africa or even all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is a place that many tourists consider a major hub.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline was compared to a glowing bar chart illustrated by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon Waterfront.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is the very place where the British colonialists made their mark and so if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Durban is the world's largest coastal rainforest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the hinterlands of India and Bangladesh.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest within the Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just clusters of mangroves - they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 sq km, of which about one third is covered by water / soil areas.
The Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife since 1966 and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the Inter-District Bus Station (Nadipar) throughout the day, though most people, especially those heading east and towards Jakhar/Bathung, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable means of travelling to nearby destinations like Paro (NU 150) and Punakha (NU 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable stayed bridge. It spans the Oiapoque River in French Guinea to connect Oiapoque, Brazil and Saint Georges de Oiapoque.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters, and a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance directly below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payagui, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"In 16th-century Paraguay, what had previously been called ""the vast region of the Indies"" was born as a result of clashes with indigenous groups by Spanish conquistadors".
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Polo Field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller competitions and matches are also seen here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for news on where to buy tickets for tournaments and polo matches.
The Falkland Pound (FKP) is the currency of the Falkland Islands with a value equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands only bank located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere in the islands, and credit cards and United States dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards will likely not be accepted on the outer islands, although British and United States currency may be charged; check with owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the island before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer here, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity can make a thermometer read colder than it is.
"There are no specific ""rainy"" and ""dry"" seasons: the amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year".
Although it is natural for many animals in the park to see humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and at least 25 yards [25 m] from other wildlife!
Giant animals such as wild bulls, deer, and bears, no matter how docile they may seem, can attack at any time.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep the proper distance.
Also, be aware that bears and other wildlife are attracted to scents, so do not prepare or carry scented food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port became the site of a notorious naval blockade in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave.
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk. About 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, Mao's movement held a peaceful conference in the city, which resulted in the assassination of paramount leader Tupua Tamasese Lilofi III.
Due to Auckland's two harbours being inundated there are many beaches. The most popular are in three areas.
The north shore beach (in the North Port district) faces the Pacific Ocean and extends south to Long Bay in North Devonport.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by ponhutukawa trees.
Tobacco Drive Beach is on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches that have good shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
"The main local beer is 'Number One', not a complicated beer, but enjoyable and refreshing. Another local beer is called ""Monta""".
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better spread.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're afraid.
The idea of a flat white coffee is foreign to Australians. The small black coffees are 'espresso's', brewed with cappuccino cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is just up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are pricey but also excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made year round and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Still consult authorities, still follow all signs, and still pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near coasts and river deltas from October to April, north of 1770. They are sometimes seen outdoors at this time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will run away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their main habitat being in the estuaries, in the river north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, passengers get peace of mind that once they reach their destination, they will get a place to sleep.
Travel agents often deal with specific hotels, however, you can also book other types of accommodation such as camping grounds through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast at the airport, transportation arrangements, or a combined flight and hotel package.
If you need time to think about the offer or to buy other documents for your destination, they may even reserve it for you (e.g. a visa).
Any amendment or request should first be routed through a travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most people attending a music festival decide to camp on site, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action that is going on arrive early to get the closest camping site to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music on the main stage may have ended, there will be sections of the festival that will play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as moving through the ice creates terrible noise for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in port. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check rules).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on the premises.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drinking can impair judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of not getting drunk.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, sleet or freezing temperatures.
There is less friction on a snowy and icy roadway and you cannot drive as well as you would on open asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to leave you stranded.
Visibility can also be obstructed by snowfall or blowing snow or by the deployment of snow on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy weather is common in many countries and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest attraction of travel in Africa and a staple for many visitors.
The word "safari" has come to mean a journey overland to see the spectacular wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, have a tendency to come close to cars, at which point standard equipment will make it easier to get a good look.
Lions, leopards and cheetahs are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a ""bush walk"", ""hiking safari"", or ""going for a walk"") involves a journey on foot over several hours or several days".
The Paralympics will be held from 24th August to 5th September 2021.Some events will be held at different venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies from late March do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with general tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, whether someone is present in the room or not.
If ironing is not available, or if you do not want the fancy of wearing ironed socks, then you can use a hairdryer if possible.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, while in others it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their own regions.
Pets can spoil food, irritate, or worse, cause allergies, spread toxins, or cause infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or ferocious animals that can forcefully injure or kill people are not usually called plagues.
Tax-free shopping means the opportunity to buy duty-free and tax-free items in certain places.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries sometimes save good money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont has some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, with frequent passage through distinct backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: Sudden grades, narrow streets, and sharp turns are common.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) and strict adherence to it is more important than otherwise.
Surprisingly, though, the mobile phone service here is much stronger than many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good and the variety and richness of ingredients in Bavaria is similar to that found in its southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastry is common, with apples cooked in pastry all year round and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German fried foods also include nuts, walnuts, and other tree nuts. The popular cake is often paired with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a small but heavy pastry, try a berliner, fankuchen, or kraffen, depending on the region.
Kadhi is a dish based on herbs and spices, including meat or vegetables.
"A firm can be either ""dry"" or ""wet"" depending on the amount of liquid in the firm".
Yogurt is commonly used in curries in the inland regions of North India and Pakistan. Coconut milk is commonly used in South India and some other coastal areas in the subcontinent.
With over 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a melting pot of various regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without further qualifier, the term means that the food originates from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a number of seasoned dishes with main flavors including peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups support the rider's legs which are hung on either side of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability but the possibility of getting stuck in the rider's foot can cause safety concerns.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but lands on one leg while in motion, he may be towed if the horse escapes. To reduce this risk, several forms of safety precautions can be taken care of.
First of all, most people wear riding boots with a heel and heel, fairly narrow soles.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety bar that allows leather to fall off the saddle if pulled from behind.
Cocham Valley - Chile's major climbing site, known as the Yosemite of South America, with large walls and crags of various types of granite.
The peaks in the mountain range include amazing views. Mountaineers from all parts of the world are constantly setting new routes on its walls of endless possibilities.
Low-altitude sports that include skiing and snowboarding are popular, including skis or snowboards attached to your feet that allow you to slide down snow-covered terrain.
"Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as ""ski bums"", planning entire vacations around skiing in a particular location".
The concept of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Downhill skiing as a sport can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is associated with but not usually included with alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, which involves mountaineering in steep terrain and requires more rigid skis and boots.
Think of a skiing trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you'll be able to cover slightly more distance than walking - but you'll rarely be able to get the speed to ski from one end of the country to the other without a heavy backpack on a well-equipped track.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to different countries often requires visa applications and passport control.
However, the Schengen area acts more as one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in these zones, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for which manufactured items are antique. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
There are geographical variations in the definition, where age limits may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be considered ancient, though they are more primitive than mass-produced such goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami people and the culture around the trade is also important for many people with other occupations.
