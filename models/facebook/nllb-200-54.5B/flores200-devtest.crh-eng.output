This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already popular theory, but also provides details that their fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the upper part of this animal's fur is chestnut-brown and the underside is yellow or carotenoid in color.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-fitting shaft called the cochlea, but had other features of feathers - spines and feathers - the researchers concluded that the cochlea evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used for temperature regulation or display, rather than in flight.
The researchers noted that although this was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, it showed adult hair, not, for example, that of a chick.

Voting in France is typically a low-tech process: voters go to a polling station and write their choice of candidate on a pre-printed paper plate and place it in an envelope.
After the identity of the voter is verified by the representatives of the authorities, the voter puts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law strictly codifies electoral processes.

Candidates can send representatives to oversee every step of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to certain rules.

The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions in general, told reporters there would be no further comment until at least a guilty verdict had been reached.
According to leaked information, the document will address the dispute over Palestine's borders, which are intended to be restored based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly included the status of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley issue.
While Israel demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, the Palestinian Authority agreed to maintain this military presence for only five years.
The shooters participating in the insect control experiment were under the supervision of rangers as the experiment was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through a partnership between the NPWS and the Australian Shooting Sport Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited for the Shooting Sport Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting park director of the NPWS Wildlife and Heritage Conservation District, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive training in safety techniques and preparation.
Yesterday Martelli swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEC).
This is Martelli's fifth World Cup in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEC as part of measures to move the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelli's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, which had been scheduled for 2011.
About 60 incidents of faulty iPods overheating were reported, causing six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it is aware of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, the ITSN announced that it had reported 34 additional cases of overheating, which Apple called "not serious".
In response, the ministry called the delay in Apple's report "really concerning".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reported that no mudslides had been recorded in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer holds hostages in the Philippine capital of Manila after hijacking a bus carrying tourists from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six people are now confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released ahead of schedule, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, when an elderly woman tries to go to the sidewalk, the photographers intervene. Mendoza is shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
In his spare time while working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth.
His research has shown that when the hormone is administered, it accelerates the contraction of lung tissue.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that government investigators had recovered two "black boxes" of the plane's autopilot.
Fellow wrestlers also expressed their gratitude to Luna.
"Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She was my first boss. Luna died on the night of two moons. On a special night like this. She was a strong woman", said Tommy Drimer.
Dustin "Goldust" Rannels commented, "Luna was as weird as I was...maybe more so...I love her and miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic were 8 percentage points higher than in 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should eventually become a republic under the rule of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those who voted agreed with this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Poll highlights: 29% of respondents believe Australia should soon become a republic, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100 and 200 m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but her health has been called into question following her complaints.
He was unable to take painkillers because they are prohibited during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
The announcement was made on Tuesday after several people confirmed the discovery in early February using different hardware and software.
Comets are likely the source of water on Earth, along with organic matter that can make proteins and sustain life.
Scientists are trying to understand how planets formed, especially Earth, from a long time ago when comets collided with Earth.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the donkeys "political gibberish and nonsense".
He is expected to run for the presidency in 2016.
The FAA certifies that NextGen is a system that will allow planes to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions each year.
Older ground-based radar technology is being replaced by satellite technology, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately track aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no additional transport, no overground metro trains will stop at Wembley and there are no car parks or parking facilities at the stadium.
It was predicted that the game would be forced behind closed doors, without the fans of the team, for fear of the lack of passenger transport.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports that a new species of bird has evolved on the Ecuadorean Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that only two generations of the new species had been formed, but it was thought that the process must have been lengthy due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's mountain ground squirrel, Geopiza fortes, and the cactus ground squirrel, Geopiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many different ways. It can be wrapped in small shapes.
It can be obtained by twisting and compressing fine wire that can be knitted.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals. It is so thin that sometimes hand-drawn illustrations of books called "illustrated manuscripts" were decorated with it.
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator using red grapefruit juice.
Grapefruit juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (pH and H) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen bonds are protons that lose electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then squeeze them into a ball with clean hands.
In your hands, the moisture will react with the outer layers, which will become sticky and form a kind of membrane.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a heavy sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in houses from the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Footwear was also present in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China.Sometimes in Roman culture, footwear was part of a public ritual, where men and women entered as a mixed group.
You use a companion when you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away.
A companion in space accepts the call and sends it down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere interferes with our line of sight.
Launching a satellite or telescope into space requires a very large rocket 100 feet high.
Foam has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that foam has done for us is to make it light and portable.
He brought us trains, cars and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that outnumber medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and hares.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, rodents, and birds.
The secret of their success is the niche concept, a specific action performed by each cat that does not allow them to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult male lions and up to thirty females and cubs.
The Irgas form a large family, usually related to each other and consisting of brothers and sisters.
Lion prides behave like packs of animals - wolves or dogs (but not other big cats) - that behave strangely like lions and treat their prey savagely.
A strong athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), glide, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers belong to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cats have the ability to roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of roaring, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that ocelots prey on are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots locate their prey by scent, tracking their whereabouts.
They have excellent night vision and are stealthy. Ocelots blend into their environment while hunting, and then attack their prey.
When a small group of animals (a subpopulation) becomes separated from the parent population from which they originated (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river where they could easily move, or by migrating to a new island), they are often dropped into a new, unfamiliar environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different traits or adaptations to become a strong competitor than it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population becomes acclimated to the new environment, it becomes less similar to other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process, which results in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale.
Plants make food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the crops we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not live.
Mosasaurus was the tallest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and it had an extra set of teeth in its jaw, which meant that nothing that got in its way would survive.
Although it is uncertain, it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet consisted of crabs, large fish, other crustaceans, and it may have been a predator.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; it cannot be compared even to a giant dinosaur like t. rex.
While much of Roman cuisine is familiar to us, there are dishes that are bizarre and unusual, including those prepared with rodents such as wild boar, peacock, partridge and dormus.
Another difference was that commoners and women liked to have communal banquets where they ate their meals seated on couches, while the rich men ate and drank in the presence of their wives.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods imported into Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, there was no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever ate beef.
The Babylonians built a major temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of the deity.
People sacrificed to their gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of their gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard, followed by the inner sanctum, which only the priests entered and exited.
Sometimes a special pyramid-shaped tower called a ziggurat was built next to the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not so important.
Much of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; instead of shops there were open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Yellow is said to have been banished from Iceland for murder, and then to have discovered and named Greenland while travelling west.
However, despite the discoveries, it was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes at that time.
Although all were 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the populations, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might not think that the treasure map was drawn on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the reverse of the Declaration of Independence is the phrase "Original of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776", which appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped for safekeeping early in its life.
Therefore, this markup must be added as a single character.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting liberated northern France, but the Seine was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated rather than fight the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and marched into Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture, a society, characterized by a large group of people living and working together.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civillis, meaning citizenship, which has the same root as the Latin civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", which to some extent determines the size of a society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. The culture of a civilization implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and an equitable distribution.
Small civilizations often disappear without sufficient historical evidence and do not qualify as complete civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first established their own central governments, with Congress as the sole organ under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, had to rely on the often uncooperative state governments to enforce all acts.
It also did not have the power to nullify tax laws or tariffs between states.
The Articles required the consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states often lacked representation because they treated the central government too lightly.
The Italy national football team is, along with Germany, the second most successful national football team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, futsal, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Italians compete in international games and the Olympics, and winter sports are most popular in the northern regions.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster of islands it occupies, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and hired Chinese laborers to work in the rice and sugar fields, attempting a diversification in local grain production.
In 1683, military forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex were built to give tourists a better idea of what it actually looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed, and restoration is still underway.
For example, the most common photo format in the world is 35 millimeters, the dominant tape size at the end of the analogue tape era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is maintained by digital camera image sensor formats.
Oddly enough, the 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that maintains order and creates dynamism in a picture.
It shows that the most efficient location for the main subject to be photographed is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under control.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity held the European states together for over a thousand years.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
The necessity of using wealth to reduce conflict and poverty is one of the central postulates of Christianity, and the Church Funds exist primarily for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been seated in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money makes many people doubt whether this belief is held in practice.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy was effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated general international law codified by various international treaties over the previous two centuries.
Britain also threatened neutral shipping by mining international waters to prevent any ship from entering all parts of the ocean.
Germany expected similar resistance to her unrestricted submarine warfare, although opposition to this tactic was limited.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing views of most citizens and most countries.
After witnessing the horror and brutality of war during World War I, states sought to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents of his own, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former business manager.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each period of development in China, or each ruling family, was represented as a separate dynasty.
There were also centuries of unstable states divided between each dynasty, the most notable of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Qing dynasties.
During these periods, there were fierce wars between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in Ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying as they fought for supremacy over the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications in the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the notion that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the revolution, the professions were opened to all male candidates, allowing ambitious and successful ones to succeed.
The same applied to the army, where rankings were now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many representatives of the oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in extra-terrestrial matters. He went to meditate in a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (light).
This cave, which has survived to the present day, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if you know it's there, it's not very easy to find. Once you're inside the box, you're in complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and many mountains around. When you are inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World to have survived into modern times.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many great pyramids built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the largest of which is considered to be the Great Pyramid), a small pyramid, a temple, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, while the smaller pyramid, the mausoleum, and most of the mortuary temple were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol for "upper bow" looks like a V, while the "lower bow" looks like a square with no sides or bottom.
Upper means you should start at the end and push the bow; lower means you should start at the bowstring (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upper bow usually produces a softer sound; a lower bow produces a stronger and more vigorous sound.
Feel free to make your own markings, but remember that the markings printed on the bow are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged four), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789, surrounded by a crowd of market women.
In the carriage, they rode back to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats at the king and queen.
The crowd made the king and queen open the carriage windows.
At one point, a member of the troupe is seen shaking the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military costs of American imperialism's conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
Through the Wall Street banking houses, the Philippine government had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the costs and interest on the bonds issued in its name.
Of course, the profits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the main revenue of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period during which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages - the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries of European history (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the intention for technological progress or technological imperative to the strict application of what is known as deep logic, which deals with human destiny, scientific laws, and their manifestation in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the development of technologies themselves follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that the "effects" exhibited by technologies are in turn innate rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the advent of the motor car led to the development of good roads.
A nationwide road network alone is not economically feasible for the small number of cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a greater number of accidents on the roads, which leads to new techniques in the health services to rehabilitate injured bodies.
There is a large element of cultural determinism in Romanticism, based on writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes personality, and the customs and culture associated with this geography over time are authentic, and are better adapted to the social space than laws dictated in a vacuum.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of excellence began as early as 400 BC and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century as crusaders returned with goods more valuable than those offered by Byzantine markets, such as silk and spices.
Already at this time, the title of fashion capital had been transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period from the 11th to the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communications, styles in the west can be traced back 25-30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own imperial style.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture engaged in producing enough food to meet the needs of the agricultural producer and his family.
Companion farming is a simple, often organic approach that uses stored seeds native to the area in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods.
Historically, most farmers were exclusively subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Supercultures bring together like-minded people who feel confined by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Supercultures may vary in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The lines separating a superculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a superculture express their identity through the use of distinctive and representational styles, including fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization involves citing several cases of disadvantaged children who were not socialized by adults as they grew up as a result of neglect, abuse, or mistreatment.
Such children are called 'deformed' or deer. Some deformed children were abandoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases the abandonment was caused by the parents' disapproval of the child's severe mental or physical disabilities.
Abused children have experienced severe abuse or trauma inflicted upon the child before being abandoned or running away.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some were said to have lived independently in the wild.
If the child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behavior (within the limits of the body) that resembles the behavior of a very specific, caring animal, showing fear of or indifference to humans.
Construction forests go one step further, as project-based learning is intended to make it easier and more fun.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but can be defined as an aid that provides support to people who are undergoing a new learning experience, using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
Bridges can be both virtual and real, so a teacher is a type of bridge, such as the human interface in Microsoft Office.
Virtual bridges are built into the software and are designed to ask questions, tell and explain what to do to tasks that the student cannot do independently.
Children end up in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, cruel treatment, to forced adoption.
Although a child should never grow up in an environment without discipline, care and education, it does.
We perceive the patronage system as a safe environment for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving guardians, stable education, and reliable medical care.
It is assumed that the adoptive family provides the children with everything they need that was lacking in the previously adopted children's home.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction patterns.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" have been proposed as important reasons for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord also identified "personal involvement" and "maintaining relationships" as new dimensions of motivation when studying audience response to websites.
The use of videotape has led to important advances in the interpretation of facial expressions - facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect human deception by correctly interpreting the pages.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, showed that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to fully appreciate sincerity.
He even suggests that similar explanatory capacities for human behavior are possessed by animals, such as yard dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that genetic inheritance has two forms: implicit and explicit.
Switches add new linear functions, and selection subtracts them from the set of functions that express them.
Separation and commutation swap back and forth between the two currencies with each generation of references
In the savannah, food-hungry primates such as humans find it difficult to meet their needs with arable crops due to the available plant reserves.
Moreover, failure to comply with this requirement leads to serious consequences, namely: stunted growth, malnutrition and eventually death of the colony.
Proteins are the most readily available plant nutrients, found in leaves and stems, but they are difficult for primates like us to absorb without training.
Conversely, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a large amount of nutrients, all of which are arachidonic acids.
Given the above, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved the 'white problem' in much the same way that chimpanzees do today on the savannah.
Sleep disruption is the process of purposefully waking during the normal sleep cycle and going to sleep after a period of time (10-60 minutes).
This is easily achieved by using a relatively slow alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you discover that you have an alarm clock while you are sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other forms based on biofeedback involve the consumption of large amounts of liquid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is directly proportional to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The less tension there is, the more vitality there is. Each person has the capacity for complete relaxation and fulfillment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own personal tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded through the Mahayana path of love and many practices in Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of renunciative love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and meditations.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods. Under the influence of various deities, the pathways are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the realization of enlightenment occurs.
Germany was a common enemy of World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. The post-war order, processes, and clash of civilizations led to a breakdown in relations between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and indeed was to be fought, with massive armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 July 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup on the Romanian beachhead.
However, when the Soviet Union's Red Army, with over 800,000 troops, invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and unilateral, and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, these plans became obsolete.
Using ships to transport cargo is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The role of the navy is usually to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its own men and supplies by preventing your enemy's ability to move theirs.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans sought to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy attempted to interdict this traffic, mainly by using U-boats.
If the Allies had been defeated, Germany could have conquered Britain, just as she had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes kept them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were traditionally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often tended extensively by children or young adults who resembled shepherds.
Wagons were made in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages were only made of planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to travel faster and carry larger loads than the more congested roads of the time.
However, it was found to be more efficient if pieces of iron were placed on top of the successive rails.
This became common, but led to increased wear of the wooden frames of iron wagons.
Eventually, wooden rails were replaced by iron rails, and the first all-iron rails appeared in 1867.
The earliest known form of transport was walking, with humans walking upright since the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "standing upright") two million years ago.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as they used to.
Although Sahelanthropus was bipedal by seven million years ago, bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement and even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In most cases it is similar to symptomatic treatment. But if we don't want to get only a temporary solution, then we need to find the cause of the problems and eliminate them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly as a result of humanity's scientific and technological progress, with more problems due to overpopulation and humanity's alien lifestyle.
After passage by Congress on July 4, the manuscript, signed by John Hancock, president of Congress, and Charles Thomson, secretary, was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made a night, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to the troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 broadsides by Dunlap still extant are the earliest surviving copies of the document; the original manuscript is lost.
Most paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lived today. We call them birds.
Most people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have fur and they can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that remind us of dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container containing medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for a particular poison.
The term "insect" is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient acquaintance with leeches, insects well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both passerines and marsupials are nidicola, meaning they are accustomed to living in their hosts' nests or shelters.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it a major neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
DS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have DS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests to raise a child and it is not in the best interests of their children.
These couples can choose the adoption plan.
At the time of adoption, the biological parents of the child are deprived of parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to learn how the world is constructed using the scientific method. This method actually verifies many scientific investigations.
However, this is not the only method: experiments, where an experiment is a test used to make one or more possible hypotheses, also validate scientific research by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend significantly on the presence of endogenous circuits and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms, which are not a simple response to external rhythmic signals, have been observed in many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will maintain free-wheeling time even in the absence of external cues.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the key assumptions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, labeling the phage DNA with radioactivity or the phage protein with sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in only the germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell loss or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, along with the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
Examples include visiting, photographing, and studying the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from their small provincial towns to their jobs, passing others who have jobs in the area they just left.
In this mode of mobility, everyone depends on and maintains a transportation system based on private cars in some way.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in public life and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developing countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why don't they work every day? Maybe transportation engineers are inexperienced? Or is there something bigger going on?
Transportation flow is the study of the movements and interactions of individual drivers and vehicles between two points.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow, because it is impossible to predict the behavior of the driver with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within a fairly consistent range; thus, transport flows have a logical order and can be represented mathematically with certainty.
To better visualize the transport current, relationships between three fundamental properties were established: (1) current, (2) frequency, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of many insects is the ability to fold the wings back over the body.
This gives them a wider choice of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
While some consider it reasonable, most believe the opposite - that the solar system, including the Sun (and possibly other stars), revolves around the Earth.
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes being six miles wide.
20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none were able to surpass the Giza pyramids in terms of size and technical perfection of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were already fascinated by the thousand-year-old monuments of their predecessors.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest sovereign state and the least densely populated country.
The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also an everyday language spoken by many who work in the country, while Latin is typically used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they are all found naturally in nature and are relatively easy to extract with very simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, speculated that all things are composed of one or more elements, formed by mixing four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It further predicted that matter had (in that order) four states: solid, gas, and plasma, but was converted into new matter to create what we see.
A mineral is actually a mixture of two or more metals. Note that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have mineral deposits with small amounts of non-metallic elements added, such as carbon.
Everything in space is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the rabbit has remained a good friend to many people since its appearance.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new means of writing, the use of pencil became increasingly rare.
People write their messages on computer screens without ever going near a mouse.
We can only guess what the keyboard will become when something new appears.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes a lot of energy to assemble many protons and neutrons into a nucleus.
It is similar to pulling a heavy car up a hill. When the nucleus splits, some of its energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to decay even with little or no shaking.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the Earth's crust is 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker above the highlands.
Because the crust is thinner, there may be more magma on the near side.
Content theories focus on finding out what motivates or entices people to work.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow into adulthood.
These theories specifically investigate what causes certain people to do what they want to do and whether something in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
In general, two types of behavior may emerge when managers begin to dominate former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
These types of managers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering discipline, evaluating performance, delegating tasks, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, he becomes an unrecognizable outsider who feels compelled to change and shape everything the group does to his liking.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Such behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and other members of the group.
Virtual teams have the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members typically act as a point of contact for a close physical group.
They typically have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local administrators may not understand.
The existence of a real "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also only one part of a virtual group.
The "invisible team" is a leader to whom all team members are subordinate. The invisible team sets standards for each member of the team.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization?
Creativity and ingenuity are possible when all functional departments of an organization use available resources efficiently.
As a result, an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to the creation of a new innovation process that meets the customer's need.
For an organization to be an innovative organization, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Encel (2006) defines the Continuum approach as a method used to help an organization achieve a higher level of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence in support of theoretical approaches to the study of cognition.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior has helped scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, such as concussion, trauma, and swelling, affect movement and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study previously unseen structures and processes of the brain.
This in turn provides us with a wealth of information and material with which to build simulation models that help us understand processes in the mind.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) is a strong genre of science fiction, AI has become a very important area of computing, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation within a machine.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence is concerned with machines designed to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include supervision, planning and scheduling, and the ability to diagnose and answer clients' questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have evolved into distinct disciplines aimed at solving real-life problems.
Today, AI systems are commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have been incorporated into video game software on several home computers.
Field trips are an integral part of any educational process. Often a teacher wants to take students to places that are impossible to reach by bus.
Technology helps solve the problem through virtual tours. Students can visit museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or view works of fine art while sitting in class.
Participating in a shared virtual field trip is a great way to review a field trip and then share the experience with future classes.
For example, each year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a web page about their trip to the state capitol, and the web page is updated and modified annually, but older versions remain available online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often begin the experience of blogging with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of a reader usually changes the situation.
Since students are typically the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed the reader's curiosity inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires students to collaborate and encourages traditional learning outside of the school day.
Proper use of blogs "allows students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can establish their own positions through the constructions of others and express their own point of view regarding certain questions" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive, bilingual capital city, and has a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south are the Niagara Escarpment, and to the north, Muskoka and other places of almost untouched beauty.
All of these, and more, are listed as things that foreigners to Ontario would consider to be Canadian.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
One population comparison that surprised many is that there are more African Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest and most independent continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are popular and luxurious beach resorts associated with France.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers be referred to as wives, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also useful (just don't wear the least expensive one).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and that being chased, holding hands, etc. is not normal behavior.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to take a step back (the absence of cultural differences is not considered good!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moorish sultan rebuilt the city as Dar-ul-Badya, and Spanish merchants, who established trading posts here, renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find shops selling crowns, crockery, leather goods, hookahs and other traditional Moroccan items, but all are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried much of the city, especially in the downtown area.
Although Goma is relatively safe, it is advisable to check the status of ongoing military operations in North Kivu province before visiting areas outside of Goma.
The city is a base for both treks to Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest viewing of mountain gorillas in Africa.
To get around in Homa you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis). The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
"Timbuktu"" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands, despite its relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation as an attractive tourist destination and having an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of sand dunes.
It is a key stop on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "African Wonders of the World".
The city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country as it has more of an Arab identity rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the west, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major visitor attractions and is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all other South African national parks, there is a daily maintenance fee and a park entrance fee.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to individual South African parks or to all national parks in South Africa.
The territory of Hong Kong derives its name from Hong Kong Island, which is a major tourist attraction.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline can be compared to a shimmering striped diagram, clearly visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to Kowloon Beach opposite.
Much of Hong Kong Island, on which the city is built, lies on reclaimed land along its northern shore.
This is where the British colonists claimed the land, so it is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of these lands.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian part of the forest is called Sundarbans National Park.
But these are no ordinary mangrove swamps - here, the last of the lush jungle canopies that once covered the Gangetic plain have been preserved.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is wetland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and is currently home to an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted hyenas.
Although buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, most buses depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially to the east and Dakar/Bumthang.
It is recommended to buy tickets a few days before the trip, as buses that travel between regions are often full.
Most areas are served by small comfortable and robust Japanese Coaster Buses.
Public taxis are the fastest and most convenient way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the city of Oiapoque, Brazil to Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high and have two lanes with a length of 378 meters and a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance at the base of the bridge is 15 m. Construction was completed in August 2011 and as of March 2017 the bridge is not open to traffic.
The bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, after the construction of the Brazilian customs points is completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous peoples, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called the "Giant Province of the Indies", emerged from a conflict between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous people.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller competitions and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
Information about the competitions and the availability of tickets for polo matches can be obtained from the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), defined as the equivalent of the British Pound (GBP).
Currency can only be exchanged at the island's only bank, located opposite the FIC West store in Stanley.
The British pound is commonly accepted throughout the island, and in Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted in remote islands, although British and United States currency may be accepted; check with the cardholder first to see what payment methods would be acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures above +30 °C are common in summer.
Winters can be deceptively cold: they rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make the air feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no distinct "wet" and "dry" season here: the amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year.
While most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, deer are wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, a distance of at least 100 yards must be maintained from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other deer.
Bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack, no matter how docile they seem.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year for not maintaining proper distancing.These animals are large, deer-like, and potentially dangerous, so give them room to move freely.
Also, remember that odors attract bears and other deer, so avoid buying or cooking smelly foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40 thousand.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval engagement in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave port.
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk. About 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, the paramount leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated following a peaceful assembly in the town.
Because Auckland is located on two harbours, it has many beaches. The most popular are in three districts.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend as far north as Long Bay and as far south as Devonport.
Almost all are safe for swimming, sandy beaches, and many have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitematā Harbour and in the Auckland suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are busy family beaches, sometimes with many shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer, called Number One, is simple but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called Manta.
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you have concerns, you can easily find bottled water.
Australians are familiar with the concept of a flat white. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino is served with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The drinks are expensive, but excellent.
Trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries related to any of these causes are rare on the reef.
But in any case, listen to the advice of the guides, follow all signs and pay attention to safety precautions.
Cubozoa have been recorded as far north as 1770 from October to April, near beaches and near estuaries.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and stay away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, their main habitat being estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A reservation assures the traveler that there will be a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often contract with specific hotels, but you can also book other accommodations such as campsites through a travel agency.
Travel agencies typically offer mixed packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, and even a flight and hotel.
They may also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider their offer or to process other documents (such as a visa) for your destination.
However, any changes or requests should first be sent to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
On some holidays, most music festival attendees decide to camp at the same location, and many consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be in the center of the action, you should arrive early to find a place near the music at camp.
There may also be parts of the festival where music continues to play until midnight, even though the music has ended on the main stages.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as crossing the ice can make a very scary noise for those with multiple impacts.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruises do not need a visa (check requirements).
Casinos typically make every effort to minimize the time and money spent by patrons.
Special food, drinks and entertainment are usually offered to keep guests happy and their stay longer.
Some casinos offer alcohol free of charge. However, since alcoholism is bad for the mind, all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or through mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On roads covered with ice and snow, compaction is low and you cannot drive as well as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you in your car.
Visibility may also be impaired by rain or blowing snow or by ice or frost on car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries, icy and snowy weather is normal, and in most cases, transport runs continuously throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, and a highlight for many visitors.
The word "safari" in popular usage also means a safari to see the wildlife of exotic Africa in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, commonly come close to vehicles, and standard equipment will allow a good view of them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards can sometimes be scared and you can see them better with binoculars.
A safari (also called a bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk,
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo had already hosted the games in 1964, but will be the only Asian city to host both summer Olympics.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the Olympics were announced to be postponed, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but since the end of March, cancellations due to coronavirus do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics will be held.
Ticket prices for most competitions are expected to be between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing up to 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes will help keep them dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that can be borrowed, even if not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can use a hair dryer if you have one.
Avoid overheating the tissue (this can cause the tissue to stick or at least burn you).
There are various ways of treating water, some of which are more effective against specific hazards.
In some regions, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, while in others, it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you can buy water in sealed bottles from a company called Clean.
Travelers may encounter exotic animals that they are not familiar with in their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, and even cause allergic reactions, spreading poisons or infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans are not usually characterized as pests.
Duty-free shopping (English: Duty free) is the opportunity to buy goods at certain locations that are exempt from taxes and excise.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can also sometimes save considerable amounts of money on goods such as alcohol and tobacco.
The road between Point Merion and Fairmont is the most difficult section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often traversing isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay calm: there are often steep inclines, narrow lanes and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than on the preceding and following road sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is more important than in other situations.
Interestingly, however, the cell phone coverage here is better than other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
Germany's pastries are excellent, and in Bavaria, as in its southern neighbor Austria, they are quite rich and varied.
Fruit dumplings are a common dish, generally cooked throughout the year, with cherries and plums appearing in the spring.
Many German pastries use almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular desserts usually go well with a cup of hot coffee.
If you want to try a small but rich pastry, try Berliner, Fankuchen or Kapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made from herbs and spices along with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of moisture, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is traditionally used in curry preparation; in South India and other coastal regions of that continent, coconut milk is traditionally used.
With over 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that refers to the wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when the term is used without qualifiers, it usually refers to the cuisine of the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, includes many simple dishes, to which Javanese people like to add peanuts, pepper, sugar (especially the coconut sugar found in Java), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are a support for the rider's legs, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide better stability for the rider, but can cause safety issues if the rider's legs get caught in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse, but the leg remains intact, the horse may pull him if he runs. A number of precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most riders wear boots with double arches and a flat, rather narrow bottom.
Then, some saddles, notably English saddles, have guard rails that allow the rider's skin to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls the saddle back while falling.
Cochamo Valley is Chile's main rock climbing area, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of granite walls and boulders.
The hills offer breathtaking views. Alpinists from all over the world are always making new routes through its endless walls.
Snow sports, such as snowboarding and skiing, are popular sports that involve paddling across snowy terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Boating is a major travel activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called "boat people", who plan to spend their entire vacation on a boat in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Cross-country skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was established by Norwegians in Austria in 1861.
Boating: This activity is also known as boating in mountainous areas, boating tourism, and boating.
Alpine style is related to ski tourism or alpinism, but they are usually not, the latter being practiced on steep slopes and requiring stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the Milky Way as a similar spiral.
In good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than on foot - but you can hardly reach the speed of a ski unless you have a heavy bag on board.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but one that contains a number of independent countries.
However, the Schengen Area operates as one country in this area.
During your stay in this zone, you cannot cross borders without going through passport control again.
Thus, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for when industrial goods are classified as antiques; some tax agencies classify goods over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition varies geographically: in places like North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be described as antiques, although they are older than mass-produced goods.
Shelter keeping is an important means of subsistence among the Sami, and the culture associated with this profession is also important for representatives of other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in reindeer herding, but were engaged in fishing, hunting and similar activities, and reindeer were mainly kept as pack animals.
Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the region inhabited by the Sámi.
The word "gypsy", although widely used, especially among non-Gypsies, is considered derogatory due to memories associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If your country of destination is subject to travel advice, this may affect your travel medical insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
In addition to your own government, you can ask for advice from the governments of other countries, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens may experience a different situation in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
An advisory is a brief report on the political situation of a country.
The ideas presented are often superior, general, and oversimplified compared to the more complete information available in other sources.
Severe weather is a general term used for any hazardous weather event that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds are types and effects of severe weather, such as hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires, storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to check for information about the risk of severe weather in the area they will be visiting, as these risks may affect various travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment course" is likely to return the address of a local company.
As a rule, in courses all the issues discussed here are considered in more detail, mainly by practical experience.
The course typically lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid instruction, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on wilderness survival are common, but publications on war zones are few.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid travel documents to return.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue gender-neutral (X) passports or to issue documents that match the desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents also varies.
In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, inspections at checkpoints were tightened.
Transgender people undergoing surgery should not expect privacy and dignity when undergoing the scan.
Rip currents are currents caused by waves hitting the shore, usually rocks or similar, and returning.
Because of the underwater topology, the reverse current is concentrated in a few deeper areas, where it can create fast currents that flow into deeper water.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue caused by trying to swim against the current, despite not being able to.
Welding back after discharging is no more difficult than ordinary welding.
You can try to steer to a place where you cannot be caught again, or, depending on your skill and whether or not you are detected, you can hope for rescue.
Repatriation shock occurs earlier than culture shock (less than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more difficult to recover from.
Travelers who adapt easily to a new culture sometimes have a hard time adapting to their native culture.
After living abroad and returning home, you get used to the new culture and forget some customs from your own culture.
When you travel abroad for the first time, people are perhaps more patient and understanding, knowing that travelers have to get used to many things in a new country.
People may also fail to anticipate the need for patience and understanding for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children here.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and before the show starts, in silence.
Traditionally, the voices of travelers and merchants are always heard here. The sound and light story is like a storybook.
The Sphinx has been identified as the setting and narrator of a long story.
The tablets are displayed on pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
The Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of active bases, sixteen as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, where Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, whose submerged caldera of an still-active volcano serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellworth Land is a region in the south of the peninsula bordering the Bellensgauzen Sea.
Here the peninsula's mountains join the plateau and then emerge again to form the 360-kilometre (220 mi) Ellsworth Range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains Vinson Massif, the highest mountain in Antarctica, with its summit being Mount Winston at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without cellular coverage, a companion phone may be your only option.
A companion phone is not really a substitute for a cell phone, as you need to be out of the companion's line of sight to make the call.
The service is commonly used by shipping, including cruise ships, and expeditions requiring remote data and voice communications.
Your local telephone service provider should provide additional information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and study.
This is particularly popular with school leavers and allows them to take a gap year before university without jeopardising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year abroad can actually increase your chances of getting into a university in your home country.
Typically, a tuition fee will be charged for admission to these degree programs.
Finland is a wonderful place to travel by boat. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are thousands of islands both in the lake and in the archipelagos along the coast.
You don't necessarily need a boat on islands and lakes.
The coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes offer quite different experiences, although they are indeed quite large for any boat, even small boats or kayaks.
Boat trips are a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is the same as in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is quite different elsewhere (in the Netherlands, for example, the number is between one and forty).
Many of the individual Baltic Cruises offer extended stays in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several full days and return and sleep on the ship at night.
You will not need a separate visa (as of 2009) if you only land using cruise ships.
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
This is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from most people's personal fears and aversions to other things.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can help overcome fears of uncertainty or being out of control.
Garment companies are well paid for delivering items quickly. Time is often of the essence when delivering business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes this has been a problem for smaller companies.
If the goods were sent by air, some routes could take days for clearance and customs clearance.
The only way to go faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airline's rules do not allow you to send baggage unless you are a passenger with a destination.
It's understandable to pay a hefty sum for the privilege of flying first or business class (or ask your airline to pay).
However, this is very expensive: according to some estimates, a business class ticket is four times more expensive than a regular-capacity ticket, and a first class ticket is eleven times more expensive!
Generally speaking, I have no reason to look for discounts on first and business class tickets on flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay for fast and convenient travel to a destination, and they pay accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic plagued by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but unrecognized by any UN member states.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodoxy.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest seaport after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, thriving and bustling commercial center located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey, it has wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers adorned with red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century bazaar, and old mosques and churches.
From the village of Haldarsvik there is a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, where there is an original octagonal church.

Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site and a place of almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are many women and men still living here who survived, and there are many people, both Jewish and non-Jewish, whose loved ones were killed or worked to death.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Don't scratch the ground by painting graffiti or making marks on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and Spanish is spoken by almost everyone.
However, most signs are written only in Catalan, as it is designated by law as the first official language.
Spanish is still widely spoken on public transportation and in other settings.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but the automatic system makes announcements about unscheduled stops in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known as egocentric, rude and arrogant people.
Although this is often a mistaken stereotype, the surest way to live well in Paris is to be treated well, to present oneself as a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person.
If you show some basic courtesy, the harsh look of Parisians will quickly disappear.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is mainly dense forest with beech, fir and maple trees and a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a very wide diversity of plant communities due to different microclimates, different soils, and different altitudes from sea level.
The region is also home to many different species of animals and birds.
There are rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, lynx and many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear a knee-length dress and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries allow unprepared women, but if you bring your own, especially if it is brightly coloured, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same lines, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
These are also available from the concession stand at the entrance, but since these garments are not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these pants. One size fits all for men!
Like similar regions of the Mediterranean, Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
Especially popular in summer is a simple dinner - Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and cheese, tuna and any kind of spices etc.
For you, all nouns, including Sie, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs and objects.
Although the writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to learn whether the verb or adjective is used in a nominative way, this makes it easier to read, perhaps.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to note are c and g, as their pronunciation varies with the following syllable.
Also make sure you pronounce the R and rr differently: caro means valuable, carro means car.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly orderly grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar dictionary will help you learn more about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
Of course, it will be easier to learn Portuguese if you know a Romance language.
However, people with some knowledge of Spanish may fall in love and conclude that Portuguese is too close to learn separately.
Prehistoric observatories today are typically obsolete and remain as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are typically located in cities or on campuses that are more easily accessible than those built in the modern era.
Most modern survey telescopes are very large structures in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms are the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom collections were held by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the noble class around the Imperial Palace.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so don't be tempted to remove even a "single" specimen.
If you visit a formal garden, collecting "specimens" will also result in your immediate expulsion.
Singapore is generally very safe and easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
However, if you are in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will experience both hot (constant) and burning sun (less so outdoors).
There are several buses north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Please note that the bus you are about to board does not go to the nearby Jewish town of Kiryat Arba, but to Hebron.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for a holiday base.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or touring attractions on the Danube or taking a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also mark the routes of popular pedestrian and bicycle paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus Christ.
Many traditions associated with the holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the Easter night awake in the open to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is possible that it was a pre-Christian Rite of Spring and Fertility.
The more traditional churches traditionally hold an Easter Vigil on the Thursday evening of Easter weekend, with the congregation traditionally beginning celebrations at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All of the animals that first arrived on the islands either bred, flew, or travelled by sea.
Because of the long distances from the mainland, mammals could not travel, so the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see auroras, as the sky will be more or less dark during the day and night.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to watch the stars.
Japanese business culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are the standard business dress, and colleagues address each other by their surnames or positions.
Praise is especially important in the workplace, where team efforts are celebrated rather than individual accomplishments.
Employees are typically accountable to their superiors for any decisions they make, and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
