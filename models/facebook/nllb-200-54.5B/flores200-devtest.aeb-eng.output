This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a popular theory, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot, such as the color and arrangement seen here.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown above and pale yellow or carotenoid below.
The discovery also provides a greater understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a fully developed bony chain, called a "spine", they do have other features of feathers - such as protuberances and small bumps. Researchers have found that the spine was likely a distant evolutionary ancestor of these other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation and display. The researchers suggest that although this tail is that of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of a large individual and not a juvenile.
The researchers tell me that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the ichthyosaur appears to have adult bird feathers rather than feathers of silver.

He was rushed to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth .
He is being transferred to Addenbrooke 's Hospital in Cambridge .
Since then, Adekoya has appeared in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
She is currently in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness is questionable due to her widely circulated photograph.
This is fairly common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts have considered that the publication of photographs may be biased.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee argues that ""journalists appear to be heading in a dangerous direction if they publish photographs or other material of a suspect".""
The Crown Prosecution Service told reporters that there would be no further comment until after the indictment.
The document will, according to the leak, clarify the dispute over the border, which Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 borders in the Middle East.
Other topics said to have been discussed included the future status of Jerusalem and what were seen as important issues for both peoples, including the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuing military presence in the valley for ten years, pending a revision of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a five-year extension.
Clinicians had to undergo more rigorous supervision to launch a complementary pest control trial, and the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were selected as part of the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS's Parks and Heritage Conservation Division, the four hunters selected for the first hunt were given comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelli yesterday swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council.
This is the fifth temporary election for Martelli in four years .
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections .
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, which at times turned violent, were sparked by the failure to hold elections scheduled for 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating malfunctions have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan 's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 hardware-related incidents.
Last Friday, METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 incidents of overheating phones, which the company categorized as "not serious"".
The ministry responded to Apple's call to delay the report as "really unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reports that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has stated that there is no indication of a possible tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has hijacked a bus in Manila and taken two Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far .
Six hostages were released early, including children and the elderly, along with the Filipino photographers.
The cameraman then took a photo of her as she was going to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Leggins followed his father and became a doctor.

"Luna was my first extreme queen"," said Tommy Dreamer. ""My first manager, Luna, died on the night of the full moon. A strong, unique woman"."
Dustin "Goldstein"" Runnels said, "Luna is as eccentric as I am ... maybe even more so ... I love her and miss her ... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percentage points from 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed agree with this view, and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
In a contrasting opinion poll, 29% of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist's fitness has been called into question by his complaints, and he had to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games.
I can 't take pain-relieving medication because it is forbidden in sports .
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water supply along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed from the impact of comets long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his term earlier this year and passed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage .
He called the rumors "political nonsense and nonsense".
He may run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of kerosene each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more specific information.
There is no additional transport and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks, parking facilities or transfer stations.
The fear of transportation shortages raised the possibility that the interview would be conducted without an audience.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the evolution of new species took only two generations - although they thought this process took much longer - due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the common house finch, the migratory cactus finch, and the long-beaked echidna.
Gold can be shaped into many forms. It can be damaged into small pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin thread that twists and stretches. It can be rolled or wrapped into sheets.
It could be made very thin, and glued to another metal. It could be so thin that it took hours to decorate the hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It is called the pH of a chemical substance, and an indicator of this number can be made with red cabbage juice.
The color of red cabbage juice varies according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical you want to test.
Hydrogen ions are electron-deprived protons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry powder together and squeeze it with a clean wet hand to form a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan houses in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were often part of public baths shared by both men and women.
To communicate with someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives and reflects the call almost instantaneously .
A satellite is launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the face of the world dramatically; however, providing an easier and faster means of transportation remains its most important contribution.
We took the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Many small cats (including domestic feral cats) eat the most numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of status , a special function of each cat that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called prides.
The lion family consists of one to three adult males, with females and juveniles numbering up to thirty.
The females are usually closer together, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions acts like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly these animals resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and kill their prey.
As an all-around athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, and jump long distances with up to five times the strength of a human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Tigris) as the black, spotted, and jaguar. The four are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not as loud as a lion's roar, but it is closer to shouting angry words.
The leopard gecko likes to eat small animals, preying on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when possible. Almost all the animals the leopard gecko catches are smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that wildcats track prey animals by their sense of smell; they can even smell where they have been on the ground.
It can see very well in the dark thanks to its night vision, and it also moves very well. The leopard gecko hunts its prey by hiding in its environment and attacking them.
If a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population to which it belongs (e.g. if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it usually ends up in a different environment from the one it was in before.
Because this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the newly formed group requires different properties or adaptation methods to cope with a stronger competitor than its previously powerful needs.
The indigenous peoples have not changed at all, and still require the same methods of adaptation that we have used.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they gradually become less similar to other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups become too different to be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen humans breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide humans exhale.
Plants make their food in the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants too. Without plants, no animals could survive.
The mosasaur was the dominant predator of its time, which is why it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor-like teeth and another set in the roof of the mouth, meaning that nothing in its path could escape.
We don't know for sure, but it probably had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large whales, and other dinosaurs, and it was probably carnivorous.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn 't do that .
Although most of their food is familiar, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual holiday items, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a species of rodent called the vole.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals sitting on benches, the rich men preferred to hold feasts together and recline next to each other while eating.
The ancient Roman diet did not include foods introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have flax, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and the ancient Romans did not eat insects.
The Babylonians considered each of their deities to be a major temple and considered the house of the deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to serve the gods during festivals and feasts.
Each temple has an open courtyard that leads to a safe room that only priests can enter.
Unique pyramid-shaped clock towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for the gods.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not of great importance.
Much of Jewish family life was outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard of the house, the shops were just open counters facing the street. The stone was used to build the house.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland has been inhabited sporadically. The Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found a land he named Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes once lived there.
There were significant differences in the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, even though they were all Scandinavian.
If you watch the movie National Treasure , you might think that a treasure map was depicted on the back of the Declaration of Independence .
But that 's not true . Although there is something written on the back of the paper , it 's not a treasure map .
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the page, upside down.
Although the author of this portion of the text is not known with certainty, we do know that the large manuscript (293⁄4 in × 241⁄2 in) was a folded storehouse early in its existence.
Therefore, it is likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
France was ruled by the Vichy regime. They were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and served the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, codenaming the invasion Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, the Americans had liberated the Free French Forces in southern France, and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is an individual culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively and together.
The etymology of the word civilization from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, also determines the type of social unit.
Autonomous cities are the ancestors of nations. Civilization implies the transmission of knowledge across many generations with a lasting cultural imprint and equitable distribution of knowledge.
Many subcultures disappear without leaving any real historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies established a weak central government - the Continental Congress - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, because it had no national executive or judicial branch and depended on state governments, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
It also had no power to override interstate taxation and tariffs.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended and the states resented the central government so much that their representatives were always absent.
The Italian national team, along with the German national team, are the world's second most successful football teams and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, sledge hockey and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians have competed in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the large number of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century and was named Formosa, or Beautiful Island, by European sailors passing through.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change native grain production practices and employ Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the Qing government revised the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Antihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of the Three Windows.
Most of the existing buildings have been reconstructed on the edges of the complex to give tourists a better idea of what it originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered and restoration work continues today.
For example, the world's most common still image format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Production continues today, but more importantly the image sensors in digital cameras have the same image width to height ratio.
The 35 mm model is actually a bit more complicated, being 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this image (divided by 12 to get the smallest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the Advanced Picture System family of formats) equal or approximate this width-to-height ratio.
Often misused and ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guiding principle that creates dynamism while maintaining some order in a graphic image.
The most striking location of the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see illustration).
The Catholic Church, already rich and powerful, came under scrutiny in this period of European history.
Christianity has bound European countries together for more than a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The all-encompassing power she wielded affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church coffers exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to question whether it met the requirements of the faith.
Britain soon began blockading Germany from the sea after hostilities began.
The strategy has proven effective; cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although such a blockade violates generally applicable international law codified and codified in various international conventions over the past two centuries.
Britain blockaded international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, threatening even neutral shipping.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its own unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors of war in World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each of China's stages or dynasties was of a different type.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
At this time there was a fierce struggle between several nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history and thousands of people died in wars for the highest positions in the Great Hall of the People in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an autocracy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to the ruler alone.
After the Revolution, the professions were opened to all male applicants and the more ambitious were allowed to excel.
The same is true of the army because army ranks are based on rank rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life. He used to visit Ghar, later called Hira, on the Mount of Light to meditate.
This cave, which has survived through the ages, gives us a vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of the Prophet Muhammad.
The cave is located on top of a mountain in the mountains north of Mecca, and is relatively isolated from the rest of the world.
It was really not easy to find it even if you knew it was there. Once you entered the cave, you were completely alone.
You can see nothing but the clear sky above the local mountains. You can hear and see very little of the world inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
It was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C. The Great Pyramid is also one of the largest pyramids built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains many pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), small tombs, temples and pyramids.
The largest pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "turn up" sign looks like a V and the "turn down" sign looks like a button or a square without a bottom.
An upper mark means you should start at the ends and pull the bow, while a lower mark means you should start at the end of the bow (i.e. pull the bow with your hands) and pull it.
The upper arch usually produces a softer sound, while the lower arch is stronger.
Feel free to draw your markings in pencil , but remember that cursive markings are there for a musical reason , so they should always be respected .
King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette and their young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, on 6 October 1789, found themselves forced to return from Versailles to Paris amid a stampede of market women.
They returned to Paris at Calais and the abbey was filled with people shouting and chanting against the king and queen.
A crowd managed to force the king and queen to unfasten their trousers.
A member of the gang once waved the head of a murdered royal guard at Versailles in front of the grieving queen.
It is the Filipino people who are paying for the American imperialist war to conquer the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonists to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued by the Philippine government on Wall Street.
Of course the enormous profits to be made from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people will be a major boon to American imperialism.
We need to understand the context in which the order arose, to understand the Templars.
The era in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages which is a period in European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological determinism or technological necessity to a strong sense that human destiny is controlled by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and technological manifestations.
Two general ideas are common to most explanations of technological determinism: that the development of the technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that this technology also has "effects" on fixed, non-socially bound societies.
For example, someone says that a car engine will lead us to better roads.
However, building a nationwide network of roads for a few passengers is not economically viable, so new roads are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
Collective car ownership also increases the rate of traffic accidents, and this creates new technologies in health care to treat affected bodies.
Romanticism had a strong interest in cultural determinism brought about by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, it was geography that brought about the cult, and in turn the customs and culture associated with that geography, which were, as they related to a society's location, better than the laws imposed by force.
Paris is also known as the fashion capital of the modern world, and Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It rose to prominence as a centre of luxury around 400 AD and remained so until 1100 AD.
It lost its importance in the 12th century due to the return of the Crusades and was replaced by gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than those available in Byzantine markets.
Paris is now called the fashion capital of the world instead of Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and into the 14th century.
At first, Byzantine culture in the East greatly influenced furniture.
However, due to the rigidity of communication channels, trends in the West can be delayed by as much as 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments during this time was the Crusades in which people began to use locks to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that produces enough food to feed the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming - often organic - is a simple system using stored seeds adapted to a region's climate, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase production.
Most agriculture used to be based on subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel alienated by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be differentiated by age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture may be language, customs, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership by their dress, behavior, and the language they speak.
One of the most well-known methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization relies on some chronic cases of children who suffered neglect, abuse, or maltreatment, and who were not socially connected to adults during their childhood.
These children are referred to as "wild" or feral. Some people have locked up lost children (usually their parents); in some cases the children were abandoned due to parental rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Feral children may experience abuse in childhood or severe trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others say they were raised by animals; still others say they lived in the forest alone.
When raised by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that closely resemble those of a pet animal, such as fear of humans or being mistreated.
Although project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more meaningful, support goes beyond this.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning but rather an auxiliary tool that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new business.
Interactive learning can take place both virtually and in the real world, in other words, a teacher is a form of interactive learning, as is a paper clipper in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning is supported internally in the program and aims to ask questions, stimulate and explain actions that may be difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not nurtured, cared for and educated, but they can grow up that way.
It is known that the foster care system is a safe place for children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The substitute caregiver must provide all the necessities they lacked in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage patterns and saturation modes.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) to study audience reaction to websites".
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
It is especially said that a slave can tell when a person is lying by interpreting small expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper that the president's speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess truth.
It has also been suggested that these abilities to analyze human behavior are shared with some animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown the existence of two groups of Chinese varieties: a latent group and a manifest group.
Mutations introduce new genetic variants, which selection removes from the pool of expressive variants.
Separation and recombination allow continuous random variation between the two populations with each generation.
In the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to humans have difficulty meeting their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Failure to do so will lead to serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources are proteins that can be obtained from leaves and seeds, but these proteins are difficult for primates to digest as they are unpalatable.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not as easily digested, but provide high amounts of protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors somehow solved their "protein problem" like the chimpanzees on the savannah.
Sleep paralysis is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a mild anesthetic to bring you back to consciousness without making you pass out again .
If you find your soul reawakening in the attic while you are sleeping , you can put it in another room in the house , as long as you make a mattress to keep it quiet .
Other options, based on biochemistry, include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a common diuretic) before bedtime, to help one urinate.
The amount of inner peace one has is inversely related to the amount of stress in one 's body and mind.
The less stress, the more positivity it gives life energy. Everyone has the potential to find peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing we lack is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extended through the Mahāyāna path of love and other techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the all-embracing path of love.
Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting and visualizations, with Kundalini Yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the goddess Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, but by the end of the war, a clash of regimes, actions, and cultures led to conflict between the two nations.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
This war was supposed to take place 40 years in the future and be fought on the ground, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defences collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian front.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, as over 800,000 Red Army troops entered the Soviet Union and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of cargo ships is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The role of the navy has traditionally been to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods, but at the same time, to impede your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
A prominent recent example is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was attempting to repel the invasion by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany most likely would have invaded Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them for their easy availability of milk, hair, meat and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally raised in grazing herds in the hills and other grazing areas, often grazed by goatherds who were mostly young or adolescent goats, known as common reindeer herders. These methods of herding are still used today.
Playing cards were invented in England in the sixteenth century.
Although the earliest train cars were made of parallel planks, they allowed the horse-drawn carriages to run faster and with more stability than the trains that were considered too heavy at the time.
Railroads were invented relatively early to stabilize the tracks, but it became increasingly apparent over time that laying track over the tracks would be more efficient.
These are the same as the customary ones, except that the iron is on the outside of the scabbard.
Eventually, they replaced the paddle wheels with iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rods were used.
Walking was the earliest form of transportation. Humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
Legged forms have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Coelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become active in reducing future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly the same as treating the symptoms in most cases. However, if we do not want a good temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem, and we must eliminate it.
It is clear that the world has changed dramatically due to humanity's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have increased due to population growth and the increasingly complex nature of human life.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft corrected by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Sir Charles Thompson was sent to the nearby John Dunlap Press.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Cash Booklets".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the balcony of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap folios represent the earliest surviving copies of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and look like birds.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
It had legs with protective outer plates and claws, and an egg, and walked on its hind legs like a tyrannosaur.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in binary form.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not show symptoms immediately. An immediate diagnosis cannot be made until symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of a solvent or toxic household chemical.
See the label for first-aid instructions for specific poisonings .
Entomologists use the term "bug" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The word comes from the ancient concept of bed bugs, insects that are highly adapted to infest humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are known for their long incubation periods, and are adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a baby .
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their children .
In the process of adoption, the original parents terminate their parental rights so that two other spouses can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Although not unique to this topic, an experiment is a test that can be used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many circadian rhythms found in physiology and behavior are often based on autonomic cycles and produced by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external cyclic signals, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-oscillating so that they continue for periods of successive cycles until they show no external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first demonstrations that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
Two experiments were conducted to label either the pathogen's DNA using radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether or not the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in some germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas who want to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife flora and fauna.
Examples of activities that can be done on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visit, photograph and learn about this species of monkey (orangutan) in Borneo.
People from small towns leave in their cars every morning to go to work and meet others on the way to work in the area they have just left .
In this dynamic mode of transportation, everyone supports and is connected in some way to their own car-based transportation system.
Science now suggests that this large carbon-based economy displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everybody participates in society and uses transportation systems . Everybody complains about transportation systems .
You rarely hear in developed countries such high levels of complaints about water quality or dripping faucets .
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic studies are difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent accuracy.
Fortunately, traffic tends to behave within a reasonable pattern; this is why traffic has a reasonable pattern, which can be mathematically approximated.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships are established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to fold their body lengthwise.
This gives them a greater variety of small hiding places from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies .
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought it was true but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth including the Sun (and possibly other stars).
That makes sense , because you don 't feel the ground moving , do you ?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It contains eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to 9.66 kilometers in width in some places.
Twenty percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued into the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza are by far the largest and most technically sophisticated.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most civil servants, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, where all of these elements can be found in nature in their native form and can be extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also assumes that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. There are also naturally occurring minerals such as silver and gold.
You can also find alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil has been a good friend to many people since it came out.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing instruments, the use of the pencil decreased and its importance declined.
People are texting on the computer now , instead of using the computer .
And the slave wonders if he will give up the keyboard for something newer .
A fission bomb works by accumulating energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
As a heavy car rolls down a hill, the core explodes again and releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have nuclei that are unstable, meaning they tend to disintegrate with little or no movement.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km wide on the near side and 100 km wide on the far side.
It is narrower below sea level and wider below sea level .
There may still be a lunar lake nearby because the crust is less dense. It would be easier for lava to come to the surface.
Content theories seek to find something that excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that arise spontaneously in order to grow.
These theories examine the motives that lead some people to like what they do and the motives in their environment that lead them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Broadly speaking, there are two behaviors that can cause managers to start leading their former colleagues, one of which is trying to be like everyone else".
Such managers have difficulty making good decisions, implementing disciplinary procedures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, the individual becomes an outsider who feels compelled to change everything the group does and has.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same distinguishing criteria as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical communities.
They often had greater autonomy than members of traditional teams where their teams could operate in different time zones that might not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a true "invisible team" has been described by Larson and LaVasto, 1989, p109 as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member reports to the management team (the "Invisible Team") where the "Invisible Team" sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to make organizational learning a long-term process? Innovation is one of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts.
In order to utilize all available resources efficiently through the organization's departments, creativity and ingenuity can be shown.
As a result, synergy can be achieved within the organization to overcome barriers to focusing new innovative actions that meet the needs of all.
Before an organization can innovate, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience-related data provide concrete evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. This serves to narrow down the area of research and make it more precise.
It supports the connection between neurology and the behavior of scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and explore structures and processes of the brain as never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines to perform tasks that require automatically intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These and other separate fields focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are currently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being used to run many home computer applications and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any class. Many times, teachers like to take their students to places that are only accessible by bus, which is not the case at all.
The technology provides a solution through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in the museum, visit the aquarium or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates.
Also doing a virtual field trip is a great way to reflect on a particular trip and share experiences with future departments.
For example, each year students at Bennett High School in North Carolina design a kit for their trip to the state capitol, and this kit is redesigned each year, but older versions are kept online for reference purposes.
Blogs can also help improve students' grades. While students often start their blogging experience with incorrect grammar and spelling, they generally have a changing audience.
Since students tend to be the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve his writing so as not to be criticized.
Blogs encourage students to be smarter than their peers". The need to engage the audience inspires students to be resourceful and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative learning tool that encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can "enable students to become more capable of analysis and criticism; by responding effectively to content on the Internet, students can determine their own attitudes about what others write, increasing their ability to form their own opinions about particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada 's charming bilingual capital with a variety of art galleries and museums depicting Canada 's past and present.
Niagara Falls is found in the extreme south, and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as a so-called "Canadian wilderness".
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited.
For a startling demographic comparison: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands in the Indian Ocean are located off the east coast of Africa.

Women: Regardless of their social status, women travelers must declare themselves married.
Wearing a ring is fine (but not the most expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to perceived harassment and that it is common to be stalked, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have a hard time saying no to people , and don 't be afraid to stand up for what you believe in (don 't let cultural differences get in the way!).
The new city of Casablanca was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called "Anfa" after it was established on the route of Berber seafarers in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, to escape the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badia, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least expensive places to shop in all of Morocco .
It is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city, such as rugs, pottery, leather, shisha and all kinds of cheap goods, but they are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the city streets, especially in the center of the country.
Any visit to the Goma area should be carefully planned in order to understand the ongoing war situation in North Kivu province, while Goma is reasonably safe.
The city is a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest ways to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can take a boda boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore the city of Goma, and the usual fare (locally) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Although somewhat difficult to transport, the Timbuktu dialect is used to communicate over long distances.
Timbuktu is now called a poor city, although its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main locations of Henry Louis Gates' PBS special series on the Wonders of the African World.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country , as it has more of an Arab than an African feel .
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.

Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the North Shore.
This is where the British settlers made their home, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest belt, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) along the coastal areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A part of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they contain some of the last evidence of the dense forest that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about a third of which is covered by water.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers, and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
Buses depart from the inland inter-district station (across the river) in the middle of the day, although most, especially cattle to the east and Jakkar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.

The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay. The Guaraní lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Province of the Indies", emerged as a result of the confrontation between Spanish colonists and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.

The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
You can change money at the island 's only bank in Stanley across from the FIC West store .
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are widely accepted.
On the outer islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with the owner beforehand about payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange mainland Falkland currency on the islands , so you must exchange money before leaving the island .
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures commonly exceed 30 °C in the summer months.
Winters can be extremely cold: there are few places where temperatures drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make the weather colder than the thermometer reads.
The amount of rainfall remains roughly constant throughout the year, with two distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, the wildlife is otherwise wild and should not be eaten or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can be attacked.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they do not keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and considered dangerous, so they should be kept in their own area.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so don't shake or disturb odorous food and keep the campsite clean.

The stirrups are supports for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but may have safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's leg being caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but his leg gets caught in the bridle, he may be injured if the horse escapes. Several precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with soft heels and very tight soles.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety rails that allow the rider to drop from the saddle to pull it backwards when the rider dismounts.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.

Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves sliding to the lowest point in a snow-covered hall on skis or skis attached to your legs.
Skiing is a major tourist activity and has a large number of enthusiasts, who are sometimes called "ski vacationers", who plan to spend an entire skiing vacation in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The history of downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians in Australia formed the first recreational ski club.
Backpacking: This activity is also referred to as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or snowshoeing.
It is related to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but does not usually involve cross-country skiing or mountaineering, which are practiced on very steep terrain and require stiffer skis and longer poles.
Think of a cross-country ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover somewhat longer distances than walking, but you will rarely reach long-distance skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, passing through several countries means that you have to apply for a visa and go through passport control several times.
However, the Schengen Area functions as a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area , you can cross the border normally without going through passport control again .
Similarly, when obtaining a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to enter each Schengen member country individually, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
Some tax agencies define antiques as goods more than 100 years old, but there is no universal definition of what constitutes an artifact from manufactured items.
The definition varies geographically; life expectancy may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
