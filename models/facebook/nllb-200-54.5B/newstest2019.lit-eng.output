MG Baltic case: Gustaine's new lawyer says he hasn't seen the case file yet
On Monday, the 11th hearing of the MG Baltic case was attended by all the defendants: Šarūnas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The trial began with the defendants' statements.
At the last hearing, Alexander Doroshev, the new lawyer appointed by the State, told the panel of judges that he had not yet had an opportunity to examine the case file.
According to the information provided by the Commission, in the course of the proceedings before the Court of First Instance, the applicant was represented by its lawyer, Linas Belevičius.
'In order to ensure his defence, a person must have access to the material in the criminal file.
This is not just a formal meeting,' said Mr Belevičius.
The new lawyer, A. Doroshev, stated that he had not had time to examine the indictment or the entire case file.
At a previous hearing, the suspect, Mr Gustainis, announced that he would not be represented by a lawyer because he could no longer afford one.
Audio recordings were also played at the hearing.
Lawyers for the defendants complained that the recordings presented to the court were of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians supported or initiated decisions in favour of the group in the Seimas and other state institutions by accepting bribes from MG Baltic, as well as influenced the winners of public tenders, ELTA recalls.
In the course of the pre-trial investigation more than 150 persons were interviewed, including more than 50 current and former Members of the Sejm, several former ministers and Members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 interviews and more than 30 searches were conducted.
Mr Gustainis is suspected of having received a bribe of more than EUR 8 000, Mr Steponavičius EUR 15 000 and Mr Gapšys EUR 27 000. Mr Masiulis is suspected of having received a bribe of more than EUR 106 000.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and influence peddling, the Liberal Movement of bribery, influence peddling and abuse and MG Baltic of bribery and influence peddling by these parties.
It is alleged that politicians conspired to bribe the vice-president of the MG Baltic concern, R. Kurliansky, and subsequently proposed or supported initiatives favourable to the concern in the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethics guards: the board of the Liberal Movement is right about the Vilnius branch's actions
"The decisions taken by the board are in line with the statutes", its head Vytautas Tamošiūnas told BNS after the meeting.
"Our decision was not a new one.
As a committee, we had already clarified this in July, when the issue of Pagėgai and Utena arose.
We then said that, according to the statutes, this was a matter for the board.
And if the board decides that a section can do what it wants, go with the committee and the board agrees, then the section can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, which the board did, then it's a decision that all the sections form party lists.
And if you disagree with the board, then you have the option to suspend your membership and go with the committee", he added.
According to V. Tamošiūnas, the party board will now decide on further actions.
On 17 October, the board of the Liberal Movement cancelled the decision of the Vilnius city branch to participate in the municipal elections not with the party's list, but with the list of the newly formed election committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the capital's liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party statutes and board decisions.
By October 31, the Vilnius chapter had to withdraw its efforts to participate in the municipal elections with the committee's list.
But Division didn't.
The former head of the parliamentary section, Aušrinė Armonaitė, has already left the Liberal Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, former chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, which we are proud of!", promising to seek another term as the head of the capital.
He left the party, too.
Elections for municipal councils and mayors will be held in March next year.
Villagers in northern India have run over a tiger with a tractor after it mauled a man, officials said Monday.
After the tiger mauled a man working in the fields late Sunday, villagers surrounded the animal and ran it over with a tractor as it tried to escape, said forestry official Mahavir Kaujlagi.
Residents say that this tiger also attacked and mauled a youth about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kheri district, about 250 km south-east of Lucknow, the state capital of Uttar Pradesh.
Tiger hunting in protected areas is prohibited.
The director of the sanctuary, Ramesh Pandey, said that the incident would be reported to the police under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, another tiger was severely injured when villagers beat it in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh.
The tiger is India's national animal and is listed as an endangered species under the Wildlife Protection Act.
Last year, government figures showed that during the preceding three years, at least one person was killed every day in encounters with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflicts with tigers have increased steadily since the 1970's, when India began a tiger conservation program that established sanctuaries in national parks and made the killing of big cats a crime.
Although methods for counting tigers have varied, censuses show that the population has increased from around 1,800 to 2,226 in 2014.
Mandatory microchipping proposed for cats and dogs
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee of the Seimas, together with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which propose the mandatory marking of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
'We propose that microchipping of cats and dogs should be compulsory and that registration and marking should be organised by local authorities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be tagged free of charge with state funds, and in 2020, cats will also be tagged, so residents will not have to worry and the costs will be covered by specially provided state funding", said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for pet labelling.
It is hoped that this will help to prevent problems caused by irresponsible breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that the expected average cost of the microchip and the service, which will be around EUR 5, will compensate all animal owners during the transitional period.
The total cost of tagging all pet animals can be up to EUR 6 million.
This appropriation is intended to cover expenditure on studies, meetings of experts, information and publications directly linked to the achievement of the objective of the programme or measures coming under this article, and any other expenditure on technical and administrative assistance not involving public authority tasks outsourced by the Commission under ad hoc service contracts.
It is anticipated that the labelling programmes will be funded through the Municipal Environmental Support Special Programme, whose revenues will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and reallocation of funds.
In addition to marking cats and dogs, municipalities will be able to use the funds for spaying and neutering and other programs.
According to Mr Mažeika, the practice of compulsory tagging is widespread in almost all European Union countries, which protects both the animals themselves (because lost ones can easily be returned to their owners) and saves the time of the animal breeders themselves, who have to spend a lot of time and money searching for a stray and lost pet.
In addition, EU legislation requires that only tagged pets are allowed to travel.
At the same time, the label imposes a responsibility to care for the animal throughout its life.
Previous proposals for compulsory labelling have been met with resistance as the programmes were proposed to be publicly funded.
'The current model should avoid this criticism, as it proposes to finance animal welfare through increased revenues in the environmental support programme and by granting the right to mark not only to veterinarians, but also to members of the public, i.e. persons from animal welfare institutions who have completed special courses at the Veterinary Academy,' say the authors of the draft.
The draft law was registered by a group of members of the Seimas representing different factions of the Seimas - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilis, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 government forces killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
Arif Noori, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four other soldiers were wounded in an attack on a joint army and police checkpoint in the Choghani district.
According to Noori, six Taliban fighters were killed and 10 others were wounded in a three-hour battle with Afghan forces.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement to the media claiming responsibility for Monday's attack in Ghazni Province.
Noori said the post was established two days ago in a strategic area to cut off Taliban supply routes.
The outpost was completely destroyed in the attack.
"Morning" extended a helping hand to Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, Vilnius' Ryto Arena will host the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup between Kosovo and Ukraine.
The duel will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius "Rytas", which maintains warm relations with Ukrainian basketball, will host Cherkasy "Cherkaski Mavpy" and Pristina "KB Prishtina" teams under its roof at the "Ryto" arena on November 7.
"Due to political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we could not host this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to host us", said Maksim Michelson, head coach of the Ukrainian team.
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always get along well.
Lithuania is one of the countries with the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We hope to get support from Vilnius.
The Kosovo team was unable to travel to Ukraine because the two countries do not have diplomatic relations.
Currently, the Ukrainian team is in third place after the first round with one win in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in second position and has a win more.
This will be a crucial match in Group E, as only two teams will advance to the next round.
In the past, Vilnius has also hosted the 2017 European Basketball Championship qualifiers between Ukraine and Kosovo.
The Ukrainian team then won 100-61.
Admission to Wednesday's game is free and begins at 7 p.m.
"Women Lie Better" star Barbara Arsobait is being stalked by liars.
It's probably just a coincidence, but the lovely brunette actress Brigitte Arsobait has been cast in a number of roles involving liars.
First, the series Women Lie Better, then the play Lies, and finally the comedy Lies.
In this film, Brigitte plays the pretentious wife of the hero of the Song of Kazlauskas.
"I really enjoyed acting in Lies because I am more of a stage actress and rarely appeared in films.
The brilliant team of colleagues they assembled promised a great result from the outset.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most exciting thing that happened on the playground was a puppy named Sunny!
All my life, I thought if I had a dog, he'd be big and serious.
I've never been a big fan of those little, decorative fife squares.
However, during the filming, Sunny became so attached to me that the feeling became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy her from the owner, but without success", smiles the actress.
The new Lithuanian comedy "Lies", produced by Paulius Virbickas, producer of the Lithuanian cinema hits "Unexperienced" and "Between Us, Boys"... and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov, enters into the comic and intriguing vicissitudes of family members from the first minutes.
Your sweetheart just announced she's pregnant.
That would be great news, except... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Before they can share the "good news" with everyone, the parents suddenly announce that they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all of this just in time for the most wonderful time of the year - Christmas!
But the ending will be even more surprising because it's so unexpected.
All heroes are not what they first appear...
In addition to B. Arsobaite, the comedy "Lies" will also be enjoyed by four film stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubomir Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
The comedy "Lies" opens in theaters November 9.
Decide whether to write off 100 million euros in unpaid taxes by emigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the Residence Declaration Law prepared by the "Farmers" leader Ramūnas Karbauskis.
The law on the National Council for the Judiciary has been adopted.
The Seimas shall then proceed to the consideration of the amendments on 6 December or thereafter upon receipt of the Government's opinion.
According to Mr Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
MEPs also call on the Commission and the Member States to take all necessary measures to ensure that the rights of the child are fully respected.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sys regretted that in this way the Seimas would "encourage some people not to comply with their obligations" - to declare their departure and then no taxes would be calculated.
Conservative Antanas Matulas, a member of the Health Affairs Committee, noted that Lithuanians living abroad take advantage of the fact that they pay a small health insurance fee to come to Lithuania for treatment.
The amendments provide that persons who will pay social insurance contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation and who have been exempted by Sodra from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania would be considered as having left Lithuania.
The head of SODRA, Mindaugas Sinkevičius, has previously said that such a step would facilitate the lives of emigrants and SODRA's activities.
A video of a bear slithering on the Internet reveals a serious problem
As the mother bear climbs a steep snowy slope, the cub climbs, slips, and tries again.
The video has received many views and comments.
People marveled at the little bear's tenacity as he climbed back to his mother after slipping down several times.
He may fail at first, but the child keeps trying, and eventually, he succeeds.
While the video is captivating, it also exposes the threat humans pose to the animals.
Scientists say that it is also necessary to talk about the harmful effects that people's desire to learn about wildlife can have.
"It is obvious to me that the bears were very frightened by the drone.
You can tell by their movements that they're panicking.
If there wasn't a drone flying around, they probably would have taken a safer route or taken it slower or more carefully.
This is a perfect example of how drones should not be used", environmentalist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Ditmer and his colleagues studied the effects of drones on bears.
The animals were fitted with heart rate monitors.
When the drone approached, some of the bears ran away, others stayed put, but all of them felt their hearts beat faster.
Scientists recommend using drones to film animals responsibly, not flying too close, not making too much noise, and not flying where it is forbidden.
The fugitive president was addressed in a newspaper
A court in Kiev on Tuesday summoned ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, who had fled to Russia, to appear in an unusual way at a hearing on his suspected treason case, announcing the summons in the country's official gazette.
The court summons, published in the government's Uryadovoye Kurye newspaper, summons the former leader to appear for a criminal hearing on 19 November, where his closing arguments could be heard.
The document shall stipulate that Mr Yanukovych has the right to participate in the hearing by video link.
On 30 October, the Kyiv court announced the end of the trial of Viktor Yanukovych.
Mr Yanukovych's lawyer in Russia, Alexander Goroshinsky, has been given until 19 November to register as a foreign lawyer in order to attend the hearing where Mr Yanukovych is expected to make his final statement by video link.
Former so-called 'Minister of Justice', of the illegal so-called 'Donetsk People's Republic'.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader was taken to Russia in a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, and shortly thereafter war broke out between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists in the country's east.
Since then, the fighting has claimed some 10,000 lives, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
Valdas Benkunskas will lead the list of conservatives to the Vilnius City Council
The Conservative candidate, former Minister of Economic Affairs, MP Dainius Kreivys, had been confirmed a year earlier.
During the weekend's Conservative primary election, party members ranked the list of candidates for Vilnius City Council.
According to the party, V. Benkunskas, the chairman of the TS-LKD Vilnius chapter, became the leader of the conservative list.
The first ten candidates included members of the Vilnius City Council Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adomas Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Baškienė, former member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, chairman of the League of Young Conservatives Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaitė.
Direct elections for mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Restrictions on cogeneration plants challenged before the Constitutional Court
As promised, the opposition in the Seimas appealed to the Constitutional Court (CC) against the ruling party's decision to adopt a law on the possibility of suspending the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) faction in the Seimas announced that a group of members of the Seimas had appealed to the Constitutional Court to investigate the constitutionality of the amendments to the Waste Management Act adopted by the ruling party.
'Parliamentarians emphasise that the provisions of the law aim to question the existing waste incineration plant projects by instructing the Government to set new limits (20 km distance from the residential area) for waste incineration plants to be built in Vilnius and Kaunas before the law comes into force,' the report says.
'Parliamentarians note that the wording of the prohibition on the construction of waste management facilities of national importance (i.e. the distance and definition of the concept of 'residential area') in the Act leads to the conclusion that this prohibition disproportionately restricts or even denies the very essence of the right to engage in economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production, as the criteria laid down are formulated in such a way that, given the density and distribution of the population in Lithuania, it would be practically impossible to build such facilities throughout the country,' it adds.
The application alleges that the law is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
'KT has repeatedly pointed out that legislation does not apply to legal facts and effects which occurred before the entry into force of the newly adopted legislation.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law retroactively on the basis of an unspecified criterion.
The constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations and thus the constitutional principle of the rule of law are violated by the introduction of such a legal regulation,' the appeal states.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the Vilnius and Kaunas CHP projects.
If the current projects were to be stopped, the state would not only suffer hundreds of millions in financial losses, but the population of Lithuania would also suffer huge losses - increased heating costs and increased environmental pollution due to the growing amount of waste disposal in landfills.
The appeal to the Constitutional Tribunal was signed by Algirdas Butkevičius, Deputy Chairman of the TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic and ruling Social Democratic Labour Parties in the Seimas.
A couple of weeks ago, the ruling Seimas managed to muster 71 votes to override President Dalia Grybauskaitė's veto of amendments to the Waste Management Act, which gave the government the right to stop the construction of cogeneration plants that had already begun, as well as to establish a "quarantine" zone 20 km from residential areas for the construction of such plants.
The amendments to the law re-adopted by the Sejm will enter into force on 1 January 2019.
This proposal is planned to be discussed in the autumn session of the Sejm.
However, there are no plans to waive the Government's right to stop projects already started.
This case will be examined by the CT in order of priority, at the earliest after one year.
LeBron James' questionable numbers for the Lakers.
The start of LeBron James' career with the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he, the organization and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers have started the season with a record of four wins and six losses, and this poor start has led to speculation that coach Luke Walton may be fired.
However, the speculation was put to rest by Magic Johnson, president of basketball operations, who stated that the coach would not be fired, but that the team needed to play better.
The team's biggest star, LeBron James, needs to look out for himself.
Although the forward's stats are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
But she's not telling the whole truth.
In the first 10 games of the season, other statistics have shown that the Lakers are playing better without James.
A +/- statistic that shows how many more points a team scores or concedes when certain players are on the field.
With James on the court, the Lakers have given up 30 more points than their opponents this season.
With him on the bench, the Lakers outscored their opponents by 19.
Right now, the Lakers are only in 13th place in the Western Conference, but a few more wins could turn things around.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
During the meeting, it was noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
'Lithuania highly appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and the region,' said Minister Linkevičius.
The Spanish Air Force has already participated five times in NATO air policing and air policing reinforcement missions in the Baltic States, including three times in Lithuania.
The last deployment of Spanish Eurofighters in the North took place between May and August this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations were taking place between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication issues in the fight against propaganda.
Mr Linkevičius expressed the hope that Lithuania and Spain would continue to cooperate closely on the European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador José María Robles Fraga is the fifth Spanish representative in Lithuania.
On 29 October, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented his credentials to President Dalia Grybauskaite.
V. Ačienė on arrest of R. Ača: I believe in his innocence and law enforcement
"For me it was the most unexpected thing I could ever have thought of.
On the other hand, perhaps the services are doing the job they are supposed to do.
We're all doing our jobs.
I believe in the law enforcement, I believe in my husband, that everything is right and honest, that no dishonest actions should be done", Ačienė told BNS.
R. Ač was arrested by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday on suspicion of having accepted a large bribe when he was the director of the administration of the municipality of Rasine in exchange for granting preferential treatment to a private company which had signed a contract with the municipal bus fleet in Rasine.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribing Mr Acz or of being involved in concealing bribes in various financial transactions.
In April this year, the Raseiniai District Municipality Council dismissed Mr Acha from his post as Head of Administration for the third time following a vote of no-confidence.
In March of this year, he became a member of the newly founded Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilas. On Monday, he suspended his membership.
Ache ran unsuccessfully for mayor several years ago as a representative of the Tavo Raseiniai electoral committee.
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to stand for election as mayor of Raseiniai next year, but had not yet decided whether he would participate in the municipal council elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas on the list of the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she expects further action from law enforcement, which will determine whether or not she steps down from the commission.
"I'm not going to make any rash decisions today, I think I'll make a decision this week.
I'll see what charges, if any, are necessary, and, of course, I'll decide one way or the other.
Perhaps I need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, it's time to put everything in its place", she said.
Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, a representative of the opposition conservatives in the Seimas, called on the Speaker of the Seimas, Viktoras Pranckietis, and the leader of the "Farmers", Ramūnas Karbauskis, to distance themselves from the statements of their colleague in the faction, Vida Ačienė, and to withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission, transferring her to work in another Seimas committee or commission.
She claims that further work by Mr Ačienė in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission 'would cause justified distrust in society and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight commission'.
Coldplay's soulful music attracted famous Lithuanian couples
On an autumn Monday night, music and movie lovers flock to an early screening of Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
The event was attended by a whole bunch of famous people: Jonas and Simona Nainiai, Ignas Lely, Martynas Tyla and many others.
The film tells the story of one of Britain's most popular pop bands, Coldplay, interspersed with moments from their live shows.
The documentary's director, Matt Whitecross, met the band while they were still playing pubs to small audiences.
The film features never-before-seen behind-the-scenes footage of concerts, rehearsals and leisure activities.
Vocalist/pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met in college in 1996 and formed the group Pectoralz.
They were soon joined by bassist Guy Berryman and a little later by drummer Will Champion.
The band changed their name to Coldplay and exactly twenty years ago they released their first record, Safety, which included three songs.
Of the 500 copies of the record, most were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, while only 50 copies of Safety were sold.
Today, Coldplay are known, respected and loved throughout the world, having released seven albums that have sold over 100 million copies.
Over the course of two decades, the band has won 107 awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.
V. Čepukaitis, who led Juventus to victory, is the LKL MVP of the week
Utena's "Juventus" big man Vaidas Čepukaitis, who played a solid game for Betsafe-LKL, won the title of the most valuable player of the week.
The center scored a double-double, which helped Juventus beat the Alytus Dzukija basketball team 86-77 in overtime.
In almost 31 minutes of play, Čepukaitis scored 13 points (5/6 double-doubles) and recovered 11 rebounds.
He also had 7 assists, 3 rebounds, and 4 assists.
These indicators guaranteed a usefulness score of 30.
This season, V.Čepukaitis collects 17.2 utility points and this is the best indicator of his career playing the 11th season of the LKL.
The Tall Man is the fourth-highest scoring player this season.
Together with V.Čepukaičius, Martyn Gecevičius and Kšištof Lavrinovičius (both from Prienų Skycop), Yannickas Franke (from Pasvalys Milk Stars) and Jerai Grant (from Klaipėda Neptūnas) were among the five most profitable players of the week.
Only recently, the legionnaire Y. Franke, who joined Pasval's team, scored 24 points, recovered 10 balls and provoked 8 opponents' fouls in the 88:93 defeat against Prien's Skycop, collecting as many as 31 useful points.
However, his team's loss prevented him from being named Most Valuable Player of the week.
His opponent of that day, M. Gecevičius, representing the Prienai team, is in the defensive five with the legionnaire of Pasvalys team.
He scored 19 points and grabbed 9 rebounds.
These ratings gave the sniper 26 utility points.
Lavrinović scored 15 points (3/4 double, 9/11 penalty) in Sunday's game, provoked 7 opponents' losses and collected 23 utility points.
The top five also included J. Grant, a forward of Klaipėda Neptūnas, who played a powerful game in Vilnius.
In 25 minutes, he scored 25 points, grabbed 4 rebounds, and grabbed 3 assists for a total of 29 points.
Such a performance of the legionnaire allowed the Klaipėda team to triumph in the capital against the local "Morning" 78:66.

Palestinian who attacked Israelis with a knife in the West Bank shot dead
The soldier "prevented the attack by identifying the terrorist who tried to stab civilians and an IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] officer", says a statement released by the Israeli army about the incident near the settlement of Kiryat Arba, near Hebron.
"The soldier fired at the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
No Israeli civilians or IDF soldiers were harmed.'
An army spokeswoman told the AFP news agency that a Palestinian had tried to carry out the attack.
Video footage of the aftermath of the incident shows that he was not seriously injured.
A wave of Palestinian attacks of a similar nature began in 2015.
Such attacks have decreased in recent years, but there are fears of a new wave.
On October 22, a Palestinian was shot dead after attacking a group of Jewish soldiers with a knife near Hebron.
Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU businesses
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate foreign imports.
Opening the Trade and Investment Forum at the China Import Expo in Shanghai, D. Grybauskaitė stressed that, given the signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to 'join forces to stop the spread of protectionism in the world' by addressing the root causes of tensions caused by trade wars, 'overproduction and unfair competition'.
'The European Union attaches great importance to China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment, which is important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening intellectual property protection,' said D. Grybauskaitė.
According to her, the opening up of China is important not only for Europe, but also for China and for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian President stressed that investment transparency must be 'above the interests of any business group'.
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - these must be the essential elements of the new investment relations environment", D. Grybauskaitė emphasised.
"Corrupt capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries", she added.
The Chinese import fair is an attempt to allay criticism that it avoids opening up its market and favours only its own companies.
A dozen heads of state and more than 2,800 enterprises from 130 countries and regions, including Lithuania, are taking part in the exhibition.
According to the Lithuanian Statistical Office, China is currently the 25th largest export partner.
Last year Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50% to EUR 180 million.
At the same time, import volumes from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials worry that Chinese investment in Lithuania could bring unwanted political influence and that Beijing's exclusive focus on Eastern Europe is fracturing EU unity.
Inconvenience solved: mobile signature service now operational
The Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions, the provider of the mobile signature, reports that the malfunction of the mobile signature system has been resolved and the service is functioning normally.
Mobile signature was restored at 1428 hours.

Angry relatives of the victims of the Lion Air crash reveal the cause
Data from the black box of the crashed Indonesian Lion Air flight indicates that the speedometer malfunctioned on at least four of its last flights, investigators reported Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC), said similar incidents had occurred on the plane's last four flights, including the fatal crash into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta on October 29.
All 189 people on board died in the disaster.
Many media outlets reported problems with an earlier Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, indeed, the technical problem was the airspeed, in other words the speed of the plane", Tjahjono told a press conference.
'The black box data showed that the two flights before the Denpasar-Jakarta flight also had the same problem,' he added.
"Social media is full of rumors.
We now want to clarify that the black box [preserves] data from four flights where there were problems with the airspeed indicator", the NTSC chief said.
In a meeting with the families of the victims, Tjahjono said that the information from the flight data recorder was consistent with reports of erratic speed and altitude changes after the plane took off on its final flight.
Search teams have yet to recover the second black box, which records cockpit conversations.
Lion Air indicated that a technical problem encountered on the flight from Bali to Jakarta had been resolved in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak by Minister of Transport Budi Karya Sumadi, who was moderating a meeting between family members and officials overseeing the search for the plane and the investigation into the crash.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Kirana, who founded Lion Air with his brother Kusnan in 1999, identify himself.
Lion Air behaved badly", said a man who identified himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, a prosecutor on the island where the plane was flying.
'I want Mr Rudy Kirana and his team to pay attention,' he emphasised.
- Lion Air has never contacted me since the crisis began.
We lost our child, but Lion Air showed us no mercy".
Following this meeting, Mr Kirana left in a hurry, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are still waiting for the results of the lengthy identification process.
Nearly 140 body bags filled with human remains were handed over to police forensics experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives questioned why the two-month-old airliner was allowed to fly after a malfunction on the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, including a terrifying descent shortly after takeoff.
Lion Air stated that this issue has been resolved.
"Is it true that the problem was solved?" asked the son of one of the victims.
- If not, the technicians involved must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, they did not say that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must be held accountable by law to prevent another plane crash in Indonesia.
Tjahjono said that the large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris was scattered over a relatively small area indicate that the plane likely hit the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was intact when it crashed into the sea.
It did not explode in mid-air, and the engines of the plane were spinning wildly when it hit the water, as evidenced by all the broken turbine blades", the official explained.
The Lion Air crash is the worst aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when a Garuda plane crashed near Medan, killing 234 people.
After the accident, rescuers led a minor from the wreckage
On Monday evening, a BMW and a Mercedes-Benz collided on the road between Vėžaičiai and Plungė, near Tilvikai.
A head-on collision has left three people injured.
The driver of a BMW, born in 1999, is reported to have driven into oncoming traffic and collided head-on with a Mercedes-Benz belonging to a father, born in 1967, and his daughter, born in 2005.
The driver of the BMW was pulled from the wreckage by firefighters - rescuers.
The girl in the Mercedes-Benz had her teeth knocked out in an accident.
All the victims have been taken to the hospital.
Presidency: no need to artificially facilitate the referendum
If the Seimas approves the government's proposal to reduce the referendum threshold for the first section of the Constitution, which currently has greater protection, the president will veto the amendments, says her adviser Mindaugas Lingė.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This, and its amendment, especially of the articles in its first section, would certainly require at least a majority .
It's not hard to predict that the president would veto it", Dalia Grybauskaitė's domestic policy adviser told Žinių radijas on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental matters of the State - language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the State - and therefore reducing the number of votes needed to change these articles would, according to Mr Linge, create a 'negative precedent' and 'open up unmanageable risks'.
'The President believes that there is no need for artificial facilitation, but rather for preparations for the referendum itself and more dialogue with the people,' he said.
On Tuesday, the Seimas plans to vote on an amendment to the Law on Referendum.
It provides that a decision to amend the more protective first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution shall be adopted if approved in a referendum by at least two-fifths of those entitled to vote.
Currently, articles of the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution can be changed by referendum by more than half of all eligible voters.
Approximately 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths - one million voters.
The proposal follows the confirmation by the Seimas in September of the President's veto of amendments previously adopted by the Parliament relaxing the number of votes required to change Article 12 of Section 1 of the Constitution defining citizenship.
The referendum threshold is proposed to be lowered in the run-up to the referendum on dual citizenship, due to take place on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential election are scheduled.
Those who emigrated after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990 are currently not allowed to hold dual nationality, with some exceptions.
Dual citizenship is sought by the Lithuanian community around the world, but it is feared that under the current conditions the referendum will not take place - not enough people will come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports 'fragile' and in need of modernisation
The infrastructure of Lithuania's airports and roads is beginning to deteriorate, so it needs to be upgraded, says Transport Minister Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the modernisation of Vilnius Airport is the minimum task that the State must perform.
According to Ryanair, the Commission's approach of only accepting comparator airports in the same catchment area as the airport under investigation is flawed.
We have to renew Vilnius airport - it is not even in the long-term planning, it is the minimum we have to do", Masiulis said at a communication conference organised by the Democracy Development Foundation and the magazine Valstybė on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be crucial, as important projects will have to be implemented, such as the completion of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the Klaipėda outer port, the renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and possibly the construction of a new airport.
'The next decade will be very important - we have to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of an external port in Klaipėda, clean up the airports, perhaps decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, we must start projects now that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years", said the Minister of Transport.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that too little money has been allocated to road maintenance in recent years.
'Roads are not improving yet because of insufficient funding.
We can afford to build new roads, but even the most basic maintenance, such as highways, is underfunded.
We must determine how much money should be allocated to road maintenance if we want them to be in better condition,' said Masiulis.
He stressed that Lithuania's exports of transport services had grown by 18.6% this year, with Germany becoming the largest export market, overtaking Russia.
Mr Masiulis reiterated his criticism of the European Commission's proposal to oblige EU hauliers to periodically return tractors to their country of registration.
'We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my view, it is absurd to propose that lorry drivers should always return home, because that would mean empty lorries driving around Europe, burning fuel and increasing emissions.
The main beneficiary will be the railways, as costs will increase to such an extent that part of the transport will shift to rail.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions,' said Mr Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector accounts for 12,2%.
Lithuania's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the second quarter of 2007.
It employs more than 118,000 people and has more than 7,500 businesses.
Dispute with the executors of the estate
Last week, Masiulis told the Economic Committee of the Seimas that he had begun negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius Airport building, which would allow the old terminal to be demolished and a new one built.
However, Algimantas Degutis, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), described Mr Masiulis' deliberations as political pressure.
According to him, the building, which was built in the 1950s, is a treasure entered in the register in 1993 and it is up to professionals, not politicians, to decide on its removal.
Mr Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving Lithuania's image.
'It would be a politically important step to remove the old terminal from the heritage, so that it could be demolished and a new modern arrival terminal built, so that when you arrive in Vilnius you feel like you are in a modern country and not in such an interesting one, which does not really represent our country as an innovative one,' Mr Masiulis said in the Seimas last week.
On that occasion, Mr Masiulis also announced that there are plans to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and to connect the airport to Rail Baltica by building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to be operational in 2026 after the completion of Rail Baltica.
Last year, Vilnius Airport served about 3,7 million people, 4,8 million passengers are expected this year and 5 million next year.
Kaunas Airport handled a total of 1,2 million passengers last year.
What are Lithuanian soldiers doing in Afghanistan?
The SNE shall report on the tasks carried out by them.
A total of almost 50 Lithuanian soldiers are serving in Afghanistan.
I'm going to Kabul.
The headquarters of the Kabul International Airport in the Afghan capital is served by soldiers of the logistics support element, who serve all Lithuanians stationed in the country, organize visits and rotations of soldiers.
The headquarters also hosts two Lithuanian Special Operations Forces soldiers, who ensure the interaction of the NATO Mission Command and Combat Support with the 'specialists' in Kandahar.
The Headquarters of NATO's Resolute Support Mission shall be staffed by military police officers responsible for maintaining public order.
Lithuanian staff officers serve in the same command post.
They are responsible for intelligence, operations, planning and logistics.
This is Kandahar.
Around 30 Lithuanian Special Operations Forces soldiers are serving in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.
They train a local police special operations unit with about 150 Afghans.
Officers shall be trained by the PSC at its own training facilities or outside.
The Avatars are also assisted by an Air Force drone pilot.

Direct flights to Madagascar will start from Vilnius next year
In the spring of next year, the largest passenger plane flying regular flights, a Boeing 767, will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly travelers from Lithuania directly to the island of Be belonging to Madagascar, according to the information provided by the tour operator Itaka Lietuva.
Blue Panorama passengers will be able to choose between 259 seats in economy class and 8 seats in business class.
The new holiday destination will be directly accessible from Lithuania as of April 2019.
Dominik Milowski, Itaka Lietuva's CEO, says that they are trying to offer Lithuanian tourists more and more new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
New holiday destinations for the 2019 summer season have also been developed by other tour operators.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start direct flights from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister for Finance on the possible crisis: it is important not to talk about the disease
"We must always be prepared for hard times.
What I want to celebrate is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in Lithuania's history, we are accumulating reserves.
But it is also very important not to spread the disease", he said in Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Minister Miglė Tuskienė will be in Brussels for the meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU's Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN).
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU's single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce some form of tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how revenues from the provision of certain digital services should be taxed in the EU Member States, pending a global agreement.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the Commission rejected Italy's draft budget as incompatible with the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the Commission has used this option.
Further information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union: possibilities for implementing the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role for the ESM in financial assistance programmes, but considers that the functions of the ESM need to be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication between the ESM and other EU institutions.
It's a white Burrach.
Lithuanian work traditions and customs
It has recently been 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and landscape painter Balius Buračas (1897-1972) in Sidarija, Šiauliai County, in the then Šiauliai Province.
As we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the State of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the vibrant national rebirth inspired many Lithuanians, including the Buračius brothers - Balys, Jonas and Bronius - from the depths of the countryside to engage with all their creative powers in nurturing, giving meaning to and preserving our cultural traditions.
During more than 50 years of travelling around his native land with a camera in his hand, Bally Buracz has provided a broad and realistic picture of our country's customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing layers of national culture and had a rare capacity for appreciating the enduring value of his work.
The photographs of Balias Buračas depicting Lithuanian landscapes, hill forts, everyday life and festivals, and our people in national costumes adorned the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines.
This publication represents a significant part of Bali's Buraç heritage in terms of national work habits and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The material shows not only the uniqueness and beauty of these traditions but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and heavy occupation.
The manuscript of the book is particularly rich in descriptions of the works of the inhabitants of the interwar Žemaitija, especially the Kupiškės, Šiauliai, Telšiai, as well as Aukštaitija and Dzūkija, their holidays and other traditions and customs written by Balio Burač.
Over 400 rare photographs, mostly unpublished, have been selected for this publication from some 10 000 negatives held in museums and archives and grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect unique aspects of the ethnic culture typical of the Kupys, Dzuks and other districts of Upper and Lower Silesia.

Tragic death of a couple just hours after their wedding
A newlywed couple died just hours after their wedding in a helicopter crash in southwest Texas, U.S.A.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his wife of the same age, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, were killed shortly after midnight Sunday when the helicopter crashed into a hill 10 miles northwest of Uvalde and 80 miles west of San Antonio, according to local Justice of the Peace Steven Kennedy.
Ironically, the accident occurred about 15 miles [24 km] into the flight, right at the age of the newlyweds.
The pilot of the helicopter, 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence, was also killed.
The newlyweds were students at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They were married Saturday night at the Beeler family ranch outside of Uvalde and flown out on the family helicopter after the ceremony.
The helicopter was about 15 miles [24 km] off course when it crashed.
The newlyweds were headed to San Antonio International Airport to board a plane for their honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the couple's final destination.
"It's a very rocky, uneven area, and that hill is about 120 to 150 meters high", Kennedy said.
G.D. Lawrence flew that family's planes for years.
According to Kennedy, he flew helicopters and served in Vietnam.
An autopsy is expected to determine the pilot's physical condition and whether it contributed to the crash.
The helicopter crashed approximately five to ten minutes after takeoff.
Wreckage was found in a wide area on a rocky hillside, leaving the fuselage "dangerously hanging", flight safety investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) told a news conference Monday.
Investigators plan to remove the wreckage and then examine it in detail, but it will not be easy for a tow truck or a truck to reach the site, he said.
The cause of the crash has not yet been determined, and the NTSB's preliminary report is expected to be released in two weeks.
Israeli Prime Minister calls new sanctions on Iran a 'historic day'
"Today is a historic day", Netanyahu told lawmakers from his Likud party, his office said.
'Today is the day when, under the leadership of President Trump, the United States is imposing extraordinarily tough sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions on Iran since the beginning of efforts to curb its aggression,' said the Israeli Prime Minister.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would deal a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, described by Washington as "the toughest sanctions ever imposed", follow Trump's controversial decision in May to withdraw from a deal between world powers and Tehran over its nuclear programme.
The sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen by around one million barrels per day since May, and cutting Tehran off from international finance.
Israel has long opposed the agreement with Iran, saying it is too limited in scope and time.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of sanctions has allowed Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's activities in neighbouring Syria and has vowed to prevent it from entrenching itself militarily there.
The other signatories to the agreement - Britain, France, Germany, China, and Russia - oppose the U.S. decision and say that the agreement has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons as intended.
The court is re-examining the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
In the case of the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, the court will hear the testimony of a witness.
On Tuesday, the Vilnius Regional Court decided that in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses in the case will be questioned at the next hearing on November 26.
An acquittal has already been pronounced in this case, but the prosecution does not agree with it.
On August 22, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted 79-year-old Eduard Osipov of causing a fatal motorcycle accident by declaring that the motorcyclist was speeding in the city and had committed a gross violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office asks the Regional Court to set aside the judgment of the District Court, claiming that Mr Osipov is primarily to blame for the accident and that the conclusions of the District Court are unfounded.
A lawyer for the family of the dead motorcyclist is also seeking to have the acquittal overturned.
The accident occurred on 11 August 2015 at about 15:00, when the Škoda Fabia driven by E. Osipov entered Žirmūnų Street from Lakūnų Street and collided with a motorcycle on the main road.
The public prosecutor's office accused the driver of violating the rules of the road and causing an accident that killed a Piaggio rider on the main road.
Initial police reports stated that the driver of the scooter was killed, but later investigations revealed that the vehicle was comparable in power to a motorcycle.
Judge Rolandas Bužinskas of the Vilnius City Circuit Court told BNS that experts had determined that the motorcyclist was traveling at 55 miles per hour [89.2 km/ hr], although the posted speed limit was 30 miles per hour [50 km/ hr].
"The driver of the car could not have foreseen that the motorcycle would travel at such a high speed", the judge said.
At the time, the elderly driver claimed to be going only three or four miles [5-6 km] an hour.
Seeing the obstacle, the motorcyclist attempted to brake and fell from the vehicle before colliding with the Škoda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes that Osipov should have given way to the motorcyclist when he entered the main road from a side road.
Novaya Gazeta: six Wagner mercenaries have been killed in Syria
As a former Government Minister, shares responsibility for the regime's violent repression against the civilian population.
This is reported by a source in Syria "Novaya Gazeta".
According to the source, one of the units of the Syrian Army's 5th Corps is deployed in the area, joined by a number of Syrian volunteers and 'military mercenaries'.
Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Foreign Ministry for information on the fate of the Russians.
The former King of Belgium will have to take a paternity test
The ruling is a partial victory for artist Delphine Boël.
She has been seeking to be recognised as the child of the former monarch since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, and Albert II had a brief love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies paternity.
According to the RTBF, he can appeal to the Supreme Court against the DNA test.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boël, the ex-husband of Delphine's mother, is neither the biological nor the legal father of the artist.
Delphine applied for an appropriate test so that she could be recognized as the daughter of Albert, the "real" father.
The PRC will give money to parties, but nothing to social workers
The Central Election Commission (CEC) intends to distribute a budget grant of almost €3 million to the largest political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), established this spring and led by Parliament Vice-President Gediminas Kirkilas, has not yet been allocated funds from the budget.
However, they may be awarded in the near future by a separate decision of the JMC, subject to changes in the legal environment governing the award of grants to parties.
Laura Matjošaityte, president of the CoR, informed VŽ that 'this Thursday there will be a committee meeting to decide on the allocation of the half-yearly budgetary grant to the parties'.
According to the complainant, the GFC must take a decision on the matter by 15 November.
A total of EUR 2.751 million is to be distributed to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary parties.
The opposition Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0,66 million, the ruling Union of Farmers and Greens about EUR 0,55 million, the opposition Social Democratic Party about EUR 0,5 million, the opposition Liberal Movement almost EUR 0,4 million, the Labour Party, which has no parliamentary group, about EUR 0,23 million, the recently joined ruling Order and Justice Party almost EUR 0,22 million, the Polish Electoral Action - Union of Christian Families, which is represented in parliament but is neither ruling nor in opposition, about EUR 0,18 million.
According to the current law, which the CEC will follow when allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Sejm, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal framework does not allow the LSDDP, which was established only this spring, to expect to receive money from the budget.
This party hasn't participated in any elections yet.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the run-up to the municipal, presidential and European Parliament elections next year.
President Dalia Grybauskaitė vetoed amendments to the laws on political parties and this year's budget adopted by the Seimas.
The Seimas has not yet decided on the veto, but the ruling party's representative, Mr. Kirkilas, and the farmer-green leader, Ramunas Karbauskis, claim that the parliamentarians will seek to reject the president's objections.
However, this will not be possible before the CoR's meeting this Thursday, so, according to Mr Matjošaitytė, 'grants will be distributed in accordance with the existing legal procedure'.
However, the CEC head did not rule out that if the Seimas rejects the presidential veto this or next week and new amendments on the allocation of budgetary funds to parties come into force, the commission may consider a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
'We will take into account all the existing legal environment in our decision, because we are the executive that has to implement the laws that are passed,' she said.
If the Seimas were able to override the veto and the new laws entered into force, the additional money would be allocated to the parties by the Government, which would additionally borrow the corresponding amounts.
The grants already awarded to the seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.
The results of Šiaulių bankas were used for the sale of shares

Shares were transferred in 478 transactions on 3 exchanges for EUR 762,172.
Poroshenko: those who ordered murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
'I want to say that no version - and there are more than 20 today - will be rejected.
Each one will be examined very thoroughly in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As president, I have neither the ability nor the obligation to obtain information that could compromise this investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to establish the truth and punish evil", Poroshenko said at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he was most interested in solving Handziuk's murder and that the killers, organizers and sponsors of the crime "should assume the necessary responsibility".
'After this case has been upgraded to murder, they are facing life imprisonment, quite rightly and justifiably,' the Ukrainian president said.
He called the public's demand for an open and impartial investigation of the case justified.
Poroshenko stressed that statements by law enforcement representatives in parliament should show that 'the authorities are determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whoever they are'.
He also said that political speculation on the subject would not help to clarify the situation but would only confuse matters further.
'I urge everyone, both the government and the forces supporting the opposition, not to waste unfounded arguments and, God forbid, not to use this murder for public relations,' the President said.
- On the contrary, we must now come together to ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, speedy, and that it builds public confidence.
There's just no other way for us".
'Nobody will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilise the country,' he assured.
As a former Government Minister, shares responsibility for the regime's violent repression against the civilian population.
She was an adviser to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack but died in hospital on Sunday.
Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko resigned on Tuesday after police and prosecutors failed to identify the perpetrators of the attack.
Following her death, the authorities were accused by civil society activists of failing to conduct a proper investigation.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Interior.
'Today I am submitting my resignation,' Lukashenka told MPs as he read out the report of his investigation.
Parliament has yet to approve the prosecutor's resignation.
He was responsible for the repressive activity of the KGB against civil society and democratic opposition in the region of Hrodna.
Bill Gates introduced the waterless toilet.
Introducing the futuristic toilet, Bill Gates likened the transition from traditional flush toilets to the computer revolution of the 1980's.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates has unveiled a high-tech toilet that does not require piped water at an exhibition in Beijing, reports Reuters.
The waterless toilet works on the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste water are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest advances in sanitation in the last 200 years", Bill Gates was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.
The high-tech toilet was funded by a charitable foundation started by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
For seven years, the foundation spent 200 million dollars to develop a machine that could convert human waste into fertilizer or water.
In all, according to Bill Gates, there were about 20 toilet designs.
The facility is now complete and ready for sale.
But in order to mass-produce these toilets, the Gates Foundation is prepared to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, poor sanitation kills 500,000 children under the age of five worldwide every year.
Combating poor sanitation, such as cholera and other diseases, adds to the $233 billion spent on health care.
To better illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates put a jar of feces in a toilet presentation.
This, he says, is a good reminder that a small sample "may contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 infectious bacteria, 100,000 parasitic worm eggs".
S. Slyva elected President of the Massive Football Association
On 5 November, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian Mass Football Association was held in Kaunas, where Sergei Slyva was elected as the new president of the organization.
An extraordinary general meeting of the members of the Association was convened following the resignation of Mr Anatoliy Stechenko as President of the Association.
It was attended by 13 of the 15 members.
The main item on the agenda was the election of a new president.
Two candidates took part in the elections - Sergei Slyva and Vaidotas Rastenis.
Eleven members of the association voted for Mr Slyva and two members voted for Mr Rasteni.
In taking on and acting in this capacity, he has therefore actively supported actions and policies which undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, and further destabilised Ukraine.
Unrest in France: Deaths cause for concern
French health officials announced Monday a permanent ban on a widely used pesticide amid concerns about dozens of recent poisonings in the west of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all products containing the pesticide metam followed a new safety inspection launched earlier this year, even before at least three waves of poisonings began in September in the department of Maine-et-Loire.
Because of these cases, the government had already suspended the use of the pesticide.
This soil disinfectant chemical should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
To be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
Approximately 700 tons were used annually in France.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, complained of eye and throat problems and respiratory problems in the region of Angers, where lettuce sultanas are grown.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but they have not precipitated it", ANSES deputy director Francoise Weber told the newspaper Ouest France on Monday.
One of the most widely used pesticides in the United States and Europe, metam, is listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a "probable human carcinogen".
The pesticide, sold under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is authorised in Europe until 2022, when a new safety assessment must be carried out.
"There was no choice but to withdraw it from the market, regardless of whether there were alternatives", Weber told the newspaper.
'We understand the difficulties that will arise for lettuce growers, for farmers in general, but public health is more important,' she said.
Farmers have already expressed their dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to suspend the use of metam in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
This region near Nantes produces more than half of the 35 000 tonnes of lettuce broth consumed annually in Europe.
There will be "a lot less sultanas, radishes and leeks" next season after the government banned the use of metam last month, Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes growers' federation, told AFP.
EUR 70 million invested in shopping centre with observation wheel in Tallinn
The new T1 shopping centre, in which local real estate development company Pro Kapital Grupp has invested EUR 70 million, opens next weekend in the Estonian capital.
According to the developer's announcement, the 130,000 m2 (55,000 m2 net rentable area) shopping centre will have 150 shops, services or entertainment venues and more than 30 cafes and restaurants.
By comparison, the total area of the Vilnius Acropolis (including office space) is about 110,000 sq m, and the leasable area is 91,000 sq m.
According to the developer, T1 is the first shopping centre to have a Ferris wheel on its roof.
It will be operational at the beginning of next year.
In addition, an international transport gateway will be integrated into the area, with a tramway and, soon, intercity buses.
Rail Baltica's main terminal is also located nearby and is expected to handle 1 million passengers per year by around 2026.
According to Paolo Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, the global shopping centre business is undergoing fundamental changes and the development of T1 has put it at the forefront of these changes.
'We have created a next-generation shopping centre that provides emotions and experiences not available online.
It is a place of attraction in the heart of the city, a gateway for travellers, an impressive and worthwhile place to visit and, at the same time, to spend quality time with friends or family,' Mr Michelozzi is quoted in the press release.
An excessive focus on entertainment
According to the shopping centre operator, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery centre in the Baltic States.
In total, 12000 m2 or one fifth of the gross leasable area is dedicated to leisure activities.
A highlight is the observation wheel on the roof.
It will take the visitor to a height of 120 metres above sea level - only the TV tower in Tallinn is higher.
After the observation deck, the Super Skypark trampoline park on the fourth floor will be the largest trampoline centre in Europe and Estonia's first trampoline basketball and volleyball court, says the company.
The interactive SkyLAB exploration and discovery centre promises to keep children busy for at least five to six hours.
The entertainment complex will also feature a 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the regular cinema in the six screens, visitors will be able to experience a virtual reality cinema with an interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to the visual effects and the seats moving to the rhythm of the film, the sense of reality will be enhanced here by the tangible effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as selected smells, smoke or fog in the cinema hall.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonia's tourism income by EUR 13 million per year by attracting more than 300000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on Nasdaq Baltic as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the group generated sales revenue of EUR 1,8 million in Lithuania and incurred losses of EUR 350 000, according to Pro Kapital Grupp's financial statements.
In 2016, almost EUR 9 million in sales revenue and EUR 2,4 million in net profit were generated on the Lithuanian market.
The T1 shopping centre was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
Cameroon's President Paul Biya sworn in for seventh term after controversial election
At a ceremony overseen by the speaker of parliament, Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, 85-year-old Biya vowed to protect the "unity and integrity" of the West African nation.
Africa's oldest president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was declared the winner of the October 7 election with 71 percent of the vote.
However, the elections were marred by low voter turnout, violence and alleged fraud.
On the eve of Biya's inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the principal, were abducted from a Presbyterian school in the North West region, where English-speaking separatists are waging an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of Cameroon's 22 million inhabitants are French-speaking, while one fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, the North West Province and the neighbouring South West Province launched a push for autonomy following discontent over alleged discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy.
In 2017, following Biya's refusal to compromise, the radicals declared an independent state, the 'Republic of Ambazonia', and took up arms.
According to the Office of the SRSG on Children and Armed Conflict, he was responsible for recruitment and use of children in Ituri in 2002.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence, some across the border into Nigeria, but many are forced to live in semi-starvation in the bush.
In the October elections, only 5% of the electorate voted in the North West region and 15% in the South West province.
In both parts of the country, Biya won two-thirds of the vote.
Conservative primaries: mistakes caused by inexperience
"Some things were missing - you have to understand that the party organized everything with its own resources.
Some municipalities allowed us to use their facilities, but not all of them had voting booths because we could not afford them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent", the politician said.
According to the complainant, the complaints were received but did not substantially change the content and the infringements were not malicious in nature.
"There have been complaints.
Not all the people who voted were experienced - they were new too.
So out of that inexperience, not all the actions were in line with our routine.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CRC to comply with the principles we have described.
However, these complaints do not constitute grounds for doubting the results,' said Mr Anušauskas.
According to the chairman of the CRC, there were cases of unstamped ballots, which led to the cancellation of unstamped ballots found in the ballot boxes.
Some campuses lacked space, but according to Anušauskas, the complaints and violations concerned several dozen bulletins.
"Well, since the difference is a few thousand, it really does not make a significant difference to the election results", explained Anušauskas.
It is claimed that 55 percent of party members participated in the elections, compared to 69 percent of non-party voters.
Both candidates had 400 observers, and 600 people worked in the committees.
The results announced on Sunday also remain unchanged: 79% of voters (16418) voted for Ingrid Šimonytė, while 21% voted for Vygaudas Ušackas (4441).
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially endorse Šimonytė's candidacy for the presidential elections in May next year.
Trump says unlikely to meet Putin in Paris
White House national security adviser John Bolton said earlier that Trump would meet with Putin in Paris, where the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I is being commemorated this week.
However, as he left for his final rallies before the US mid-term elections, Trump told reporters he was not sure it would be the right time to meet the Russian president.
"I'm not sure I'll see you in Paris.
Probably not", said the U.S. president.
However, he added, they would meet at the G20 summit and "probably many times" thereafter.
Trump continues to try to reset relations with Moscow, despite allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
Kęstutis Strupas seeks annulment of the decision of the VTEK
Kęstutis Strupas, former director general of Vilnius University's Santaros Clinic, is asking for the decision of the Chief Ethics Commission (VTEK) to be annulled.
Strup's appeal was heard on Tuesday by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant is seeking the annulment of VTEK's decision of May 23, court spokeswoman Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė told BNS.
Mr Strup considers that gifts to relatives do not have to be declared, as he understands an exception to the law.
VTEK announced in May that the then dismissed general director of the Santaros Clinics, K. Strupas, and the head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department of the Vilnius Republican University Hospital, Silvija Strupienė, had violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
The investigation established that four transactions were not declared within the deadlines: a bank loan taken out with my spouse in 2010, the purchase of securities from a bank in 2017, the gift of an apartment to my daughter in 2017 and a loan granted to a natural person together with my spouse in 1996 and not reimbursed.
Mr Strupienė also declared these transactions after the deadline.
Persons who violate the law on the reconciliation of public and private interests in the civil service cannot be promoted for one year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own data but also that of your spouse.
VTEK carried out the study on the basis of information from Info TV.
It was examined whether Mr Strupas and his wife, Ms Strupienė, Head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department at the Vilnius Republican University Hospital, had properly and timely declared their transactions.
According to Info TV, last year Strup gave his daughter a property worth 125,000 euros.
However, the former director of the Santara Clinics and his wife did not mention this in their declarations of interests.
Strup, along with at least a dozen others, has been indicted by law enforcement on suspicion of corruption.
In this way, Strup is alleged to have negotiated at least five times with the Santara Clinics in the context of public procurement in the field of information technology.
K. Struve himself denies his guilt.
Suspected of corruption, Professor K. Strup was dismissed as head of the Santara Clinic in September.
By decision of the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University, the contracting clinics terminated their employment relationship with Mr Strupų at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since 10 November 2013.
Professor Juozas Raistenskis will continue to lead the Santaros Clinics on an interim basis until a competition is held to elect a new Director-General, which is expected to be announced later this year.
President congratulates L. Gutauskas on his anniversary
According to the Head of State, L. Gutauskas combines religious, historical and philosophical metaphors, eternal values into a whole of art, reveals the millennial wisdom and memory of the nation.
The author's beloved and appreciated work - poetry, prose, children's literature, painting, book illustrations - testifies that L. Gutauskas is a multi-talented artist.
Congratulating the artist on his jubilee, the President thanked him for his significant works, which have enriched Lithuania, and wished him inspiration, happiness and success.
Schools are already promising less testing and more practice
Such changes in the content of education are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them on Monday at the forum "Changing the content of education: foreign experience for solutions in Lithuania" held in Vilnius.
Speaking at the debate, Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė said that over the past ten years, more than EUR 30 million had been invested in updating the content of education, but no results had been seen.
'According to the results of the international PISA study, pupils' achievements are below the OECD average,' said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
OECD expert Phil Lambert, quoted in the Ministry of Education and Science's report, said that Lithuania was too focused on imparting knowledge rather than applying it.
According to him, Lithuania's general education programmes focus on developing students' literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also needed to develop children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
Vice-Minister of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevičius, presenting the changes in the content of general education, said that the scope of the programmes to be updated starting this academic year will be smaller, they will be more specific and the disciplines will be more closely linked to each other.
According to the Deputy Minister, pupils' education will be more individualised, schools will become more autonomous - they will be allowed to prepare between 10 and 30 per cent of their unique educational content, the current pupil assessment system will change to a cumulative score, and pupils' non-formally acquired competences will gain greater weight.
There will be fewer standardized tests.
The general curriculum is promised to be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources, a task bank.
The renewal of the content of education aims to improve the performance of pupils in the international PISA study by at least 10%, to reduce the gap between pupils' achievements by one third, to ensure that pupils acquire modern competences at school and are literate in various fields.
Lithuania plans to allocate an amount of EUR 7,8 million from the European Union and the state budget to update the content of education from May 2018.
This appropriation is intended to cover expenditure on studies, meetings of experts, information and publications directly linked to the achievement of the objective of the programme or measures coming under this article, and any other expenditure on technical and administrative assistance not involving public authority tasks outsourced by the Commission under ad hoc service contracts.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry was criticised for a nearly €8 million project by the Centre for Educational Development to update the general curricula of primary, basic and secondary education.
With a budget of €7.8 million over four years, a first €1.3 million call for educational programme providers was launched at the beginning of October.
After the experts criticized this procurement, it was suspended, and the Minister of Education and Science J. Petrauskienė dismissed the director of the Educational Development Centre, Giedrius Vaidelis.
Exercises to respond to extreme flooding in Lithuania
In Lithuania, a ten-day exercise to improve the authorities' response to extreme flooding begins on Monday.
According to the Department of Fire Protection and Rescue (PAGD), the exercise will test the readiness of state institutions to work in the country in the event of a national emergency such as a flood: to eliminate its consequences, to coordinate the search, rescue and emergency evacuation of people from flooded areas, to organize their supply of drinking water, food, to ensure the necessary energy supply and to take other measures to protect the population.
The exercise will involve more than 100 representatives from all ministries and other institutions in the country, as well as members of the 12 municipal emergency operations centres.
The preparatory phase of the exercise will take place from 5 to 13 November, during which the municipalities will decide on the management of the emergency situation based on the information received from the PAGD from the Hydrometeorological Service about continuous rainfall and the onset of flooding.
The active phase of the exercise is scheduled for 14-15 November.
The State Emergency Operations Centre will operate in the department and the Institutional Emergency Operations Centres in state and municipal institutions.
Following the declaration by the Government of a State of Emergency due to the effects of the floods, the Head of Operations appointed by the Prime Minister will lead the liquidation of the emergency situation, the elimination of its consequences, the protection and rescue of people and property.
According to Mindaugas Kanapickas, deputy director of PAGD, the main purpose of the exercise is to check the readiness of the institutions to carry out the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibilities of exchanging information, to check how prepared the population, state and municipal institutions, institutions and enterprises are to warn and inform about the impending disaster, and to "improve the emergency management skills of state institutions".
The exercise will also demonstrate the joint capabilities of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian fire and rescue services to pump large volumes of water out of flooded areas.
The BalticFloodCombat module was set up in 2009 for this purpose.
Resignation of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine
Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko announced his resignation in a speech to the country's parliament on Tuesday in response to the public outcry over the death of anti-corruption activist Kateryna Gandziuk, who was doused in acid, reports the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
According to Ukrainian law, the Prosecutor General must submit his resignation to the President of Ukraine, who in turn submits it to the Verkhovna Rada for approval by a majority vote.
On Tuesday, Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko presented the progress and results of the law enforcement investigation into the ordering of Gandziuk's murder in the Verkhovna Rada.
In a speech to parliament, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage that Gandziuk's death was being exploited by politicians for PR.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist who spoke publicly about police corruption in her hometown of Kherson in southern Ukraine.
On 31 July, outside her home, an unknown assailant threw acid in her face.
She died of her injuries in hospital on 4 November.
Protesters outside the Ukrainian Interior Ministry are demanding answers about who killed Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix
According to the stated activities of the general staff, by exercising operational control over the armed forces, he is actively involved in shaping and implementing the Russian government policy threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.
However, one of the most plausible versions of the investigation was leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
According to the Prosecutor General, due to the leakage of information, the suspects acquired essential knowledge.
Lucenko added that he personally knew Gandziuk and was outraged that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
"So that no one has reason to say that someone is clinging to power, I wish to announce that I am submitting my resignation.
Today I will submit it to the President of Ukraine and you will have to discuss it in parliament,' Mr Lutsenko was quoted as saying in the Rada by the newspaper Obzrevatel.
According to the newspaper, Lutsenko added that "two governments cannot be allowed in the country, when the law enforcement system collapses without any evidence, even for revealed crimes".
He is considered a close associate of President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed General Prosecutor on 12 May 2016 after protracted efforts to dismiss his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, who was suspected of covering up corruption of high-level officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
According to Aurelija Vernickaitė, Advisor to the Minister of Energy, the meeting will focus on the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector currently not on the aggregated EU-level trajectories of the National Renewable Energy Action Plans, with a 6% share of renewable energy in 2015.
The Commission considers that progress towards the mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to various difficulties, including the relatively high cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%), while electricity plays a minor role at this stage.
The Seimas took the initiative to supplement the issues of the proposed corruption investigation with an appeal by the Conservatives to the Constitutional Tribunal
On Tuesday, the Seimas approved such a proposal, which was registered by Agnė Širinskienė, a "farmer" leading an investigation into illegal influence on political processes.
The Commission considers that the Polish authorities have not respected their obligations pursuant to Article 1 (3) of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU.
The draft will now be discussed by the Seimas committees, the main one being the Law and Order Committee headed by A. Širinskienė.
Following its conclusion, the adoption of the amendment to the Decision shall be put to the vote.
As a former Government Minister, shares responsibility for the regime's violent repression against the civilian population.
A. Širinskienė proposed to extend this deadline, stating that 'significant information has appeared in the public domain about possible unlawful influence and impact on political processes and state institutions'.
A. Širinskienė identifies in the draft 'possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by appealing to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the Chief Commission for Professional Ethics'.
The appeal to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by the opposition conservatives.
The governing Landtag found that the Conservatives had relied heavily on the arguments of the private pension funds' lawyers in their appeal.
The leaders of the 'Farmers' accuse former comrade Povilas Urbšys of influencing the Supreme Commission for Official Ethics (VTEK).
According to them, the former Chairman of the State Administration and Municipalities Committee of the Seimas could have instructed the members of the STEC to dismiss the former Head of the Prevention Department of the Commission, Mindaugas Siaurys.
At the end of September, the Seimas set up a commission to investigate the possible unlawful influence of interested persons or groups on the electoral process, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary factions, individual politicians, the activities and financing of parties and social movements, the legislative process, the election and appointment of heads of state-owned enterprises and public institutions, and members of management or supervisory bodies.
It is also suggested to inquire what information law enforcement and intelligence agencies have provided to the competent authorities and how it has been acted upon.
Researchers are expected to present their findings by 1 May of the following year.
At the same time, there will be campaigns for the presidential and European Parliament elections.
Seven of the 12 members of the commission are representatives of the 'farmers'.
Two social workers were also appointed as members, one 'orderly' liberal and one representative of the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania-Union of Christian Families.
The Conservatives and the Social Democrats refused to take part in the committee's work.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskis, chairman of the ruling Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union.
According to him, the investigation conducted by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSDC) at the previous session on essentially the same issues showed that the investigation should be continued.
The head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency has lost his job.
The 55-year-old Maassen added fuel to the controversy by blaming his troubles on the "radical left" in Merkel's coalition.
As a result, instead of being transferred to another post as promised, he was forced into retirement.
Last weekend, it emerged that Maassen had criticised Merkel's 'naive' immigration policy at a meeting of representatives of European domestic intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks earlier.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has long defended the intelligence chief, told a news conference on Monday that Maassen's latest comments were unacceptable and "personally disappointing".
Seehofer, himself under pressure both from the controversy and from his party's poor showing in the Bavarian local elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release Maassen.
A string of shark attacks has terrorized the island, resulting in the death of a third person
The Queensland Ambulance Service reports that the victim suffered "serious leg and wrist injuries" in the attack near Sid Harbor on Pentecost Island, off the Queensland coast.
The man was taken to the hospital by helicopter.
Whitsunday Island is the largest of the Whitsunday Islands and attracts many diving and sailing enthusiasts from all over the world.
Shark attacks have been relatively rare in the region so far.
On September 19, a woman was attacked in Sid Harbor, and the following day a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last time there was a shark attack in this archipelago before the most recent was in 2010.
The CoR has two new members, Viscount and Pux
Mr Puks was nominated as a member of the CoR by the Lithuanian Bar Association.
He will replace Ms Svajona Šaltauskienė, a delegate from the Law Society who has resigned from the CoR.
Mr Viskontas, a lawyer, has been nominated as a member of the CoR by the Order and Justice Party.
The party has no representative in the CEC since Donatas Laurinavičius left the party.
In a secret ballot, the candidacy of A. Puks was supported by 74 members of the Seimas, 5 were against and 6 abstained.

Fat girls are breaking down stereotypes about wedding dresses
Fat girl in a puffy white wedding dress - mission (impossible)?
Can a white swan swimming down the aisle be bigger than an S or an M and still look attractive?
Today, the plus-size contestants of the reality show Size (r) Evolution will prove that a bride's beauty and elegance do not depend on her weight.
But that's not all - one of the project girls will shed tears of joy tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the set.
"Then there are those who believe that chubby girls do not attract attention or looks.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete, but he likes me the way I am, he doesn't expect me to have a standard figure", says Aurika, a contestant on the show, before she appears in her wedding dress.
A wedding dress is not light, in every sense, a dress is a complex construction, it has a lot of material, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable to move.
Also, some women feel that a heavier girl in a white dress will make them look even heavier and thus less confident.
I can assure you that a well-chosen dress really solves this 'problem,'" explained fashion designer Robert Kalinkin, one of the show's judges.
The fate of the girls in the project is decided by R. Kalinkin together with the entire commission - plus-size fashion house founder Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social media star Naglia Bieranc and TV producer Laura Paukšte.
"There is a lot of bickering among the judges about which girl should leave the show - we all come from different backgrounds and have different ideas about who should win.
To make the task of demonstrating wedding dresses even more difficult, I can now reveal that there were two newcomers who were no worse than the old ones.
It was a special evening in every sense of the word", says Kalinkin.
The newcomers - 23-year-old Eva, who became famous for her scandalous behavior on a summer reality show, and 31-year-old Doville, a stunningly beautiful mother of two - joined the rest of the contestants and made it to the top 20.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photoshoot of the girls on the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The LNK viewers voted for their favorites on the television portal.
The internationally acclaimed fat beauty reality show is now in its second week in Lithuania, where plus-size girls compete for the title of the country's first plus-size star.
So far, only eight are left, and they all know there can only be one winner.
The week of the intriguing and unpredictable reality show "The (r) evolution of greatness" begins this Monday evening at 8:30 p.m. on LNK.
Actor Elba voted sexiest man in the world
People magazine has named this year's sexiest man alive.
The winner was 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man said that the news was unexpected, he had a good sense of humor about his new title.
I thought, "No way!
Are you serious?"
And then I looked at myself in the mirror and I thought, yes, I look sexy today", the actor shared with a laugh.
Speaking frankly, Idris described the title as a very pleasant feeling that flattered his ego.
The British star claims that he was often verbally abused and bullied, which made his childhood difficult because, as he says, he was "very tall and clumsy".
The young actor was also disliked and mocked by his peers because of his unusual name and his African heritage.
"As soon as I grew a mustache and muscles, I became the toughest kid in my neighborhood", smiles Idris.
When her husband is not on the silver screen, Elba is a DJ at parties in Spain, especially in the lively town of Ibiza.
In his spare time, he enjoys Thai boxing and has a flair for fashion, which he expresses by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor claims that family is the most important thing in the world to him, which is why he is planning to marry his fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba was named the 33rd sexiest man in the world by People magazine.
In 2017, Blake Shelton won the title.
A man beaten to death during a drinking party in the Širvintų district
A man was beaten to death while drinking in the village of Šalkiškės in Širvintų district on Monday evening.
According to the Vilnius County Police, at 9:16 p.m. a report was received that a man had been drinking and had beaten his neighbor.
On arrival, doctors pronounced the man, born in 1943, dead.
The suspect, born in 1994, was arrested with a blood alcohol level of 2.53.
The police are investigating the incident.
The authorities no longer require a distance of 20 km when constructing waste incineration plants
The Vilnius cogeneration plant is under construction near Gariūnai market.
Incineration plants are no longer required to be within 12 miles [20 km] of residential areas.
The head of the Environmental Protection Committee, "farmer" Kęstutis Mažeika, registered an amendment to the Law on Waste Management in the Seimas on Monday, rejecting such a requirement.
According to Mr Mažeika, the Farmers' Group, which had previously supported the provision on the 20 km distance, intends to support the amendment on its abandonment.
Mr Mažeika's amendment provides that from January 2019 waste incineration plants could be built in compliance with the legal requirements on environmental protection and public health protection.
He acknowledged that the amendments raised doubts in the president's mind about the ban.
'Considering the definition of a residential area, it is obvious that it would be almost impossible to find a site suitable for the construction of the above-mentioned objects,' states the committee chairman.
The ruling majority in October rejected a presidential veto on amendments to tighten construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to prohibiting the construction of waste incineration plants closer than 20 km from settlements, the amendments authorised the Government to decide on the future of the two plants already under construction, taking into account the interests of public health.
Mr Mažeika does not propose to amend the latter provisions.
The energy group Lietuvos Energija is building a waste-to-energy and biofuel power plant in Vilnius and Fortum Heat Lietuva is building a waste-to-energy and biofuel power plant in Kaunas together with the Finnish energy group Fortum.
The latter already incinerates waste in Klaipeda.
There is talk of a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
The leaders of Britain and Ireland discussed a possible compromise on Monday to resolve the thorny issue of Northern Ireland, which has stalled Brexit negotiations, Dublin said.
In a telephone conversation, British Prime Minister Theresa May suggested the possibility of revising the so-called backstop agreement mechanism, which would allow for an open border between the United Kingdom province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider the proposal but ruled out any possibility of Britain unilaterally withdrawing from the agreement, according to a statement released by the Irish government.
In the conversation, Mrs May 'raised the possibility of reviewing the hedging mechanism', it said.
'Varadkar has indicated that he is open to reviewing the new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review does not involve a unilateral decision to lift the safeguard measures,' the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators are struggling to find an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the land border between the UK and Ireland when Britain leaves the single market and customs union next March.
The two sides agree on 'safeguard measures' to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open pending a wider trade agreement to ensure that additional customs checks are not carried out at the border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to abide by EU customs rules, but London wants them to apply temporarily to the whole of the UK.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab wants Britain to be able to unilaterally withdraw from the backstop in three months.
However, Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support this".
"Three-month or limited-term hedging instruments are not worth the paper they are written on", he stated.
Earlier, London and Brussels denied reports of a breakthrough in Brexit negotiations after reports emerged in Britain over the weekend that an agreement was within reach.
'I would say we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to do,' said May's spokesman in London.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas also told reporters: "We are not there yet".
Nobel laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to reliable information in the Internet age.
Among the 25 signatories of the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, and writer Mario Vargas Llosa, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.
"We urge leaders of goodwill on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate in which citizens can make decisions based on facts", the group said in a statement.
They argue that the "global information and communications space" is a common good that "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion".
"People have a fundamental right to information that is freely gathered, processed and disseminated, based on the principles of a commitment to truth, pluralism of views and rational methods of fact-finding", the declaration added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who is often critical of 'fake news' but is regularly accused of distorting facts.
World leaders should take a stand on the issue when they meet at the Paris Peace Forum from 11 to 13 November, urged the signatories.
The declaration was drafted over a two-month period under the direction of Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, head of Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a Paris-based organisation that defends media freedom and journalists' rights.
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao, and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
Parliament approves higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Law on Product Safety providing for increased fines for violations of product safety.
The amendments were approved unanimously in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Parliamentary Health Committee, said about the new draft, it is welcome that the objectives are related to better consumer protection of products.
In addition, its provisions are adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
'My head, in the proposed draft law are distributed more precisely and specifically to all actors involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
Practice shows that the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements, as those who have paid the fines continue to commit repeated infringements,' said Mr Vinkus.
The draft was drawn up by the Ministry of Economy and, after approval by the Government, supplemented by the Economic Committee of the Seimas.
The amendments to the law aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen consumer protection, give more powers to market surveillance authorities and create a clear system for monitoring and enforcing product safety requirements.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for producers to label the product properly to ensure its traceability.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, market surveillance authorities are not granted the right to enter the territory, buildings, premises of manufacturers and suppliers to carry out inspections in the course of state control of product safety, which complicates the work of the authorities.
The Ministry considers that the six-month deadline for the imposition of fines and periodic penalty payments is too short to identify the infringement, conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
Also, according to the Ministry, the fines imposed are not sufficiently effective.
In addition, the GOC claimed that the Commission did not provide any evidence that the GOC exercised meaningful control over the conduct of the cooperating exporting producers.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to impose on manufacturers the obligation to properly label the product in order to ensure its traceability in order to facilitate market surveillance authorities in identifying suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities, in the context of official controls on product safety, the right to enter and inspect the premises of economic operators which manufacture or place products on the market.
Fines for violations of the law are to be increased.
A manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who places dangerous products on the market and a distributor who makes them available on the market or provides a dangerous service would be liable to a fine of between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 (currently between EUR 144 and EUR 1 448).
A fine of between EUR 1 000 and EUR 5 000 (currently between EUR 868 and EUR 4 344) would be imposed if a national consumer protection authority or another market surveillance authority decided to prohibit the placing on the market and supply of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services.
Failure to comply with the requirement to withdraw dangerous products from the market, recall them from consumers and destroy them would lead to a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6 500 (currently between EUR 1 448 and EUR 5 792).
A fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (currently between EUR 1 448 and EUR 11584) would be imposed if dangerous products caused damage to the health of consumers.
If a dangerous product caused the death of a consumer, the fine would be between EUR 6 500 and EUR 25 000 (currently between EUR 5 792 and EUR 23 169).
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, infringements of product safety legislation are punishable by fines of up to EUR 25 000 (there is no minimum amount), in Belgium by fines of between EUR 26 000 and EUR 600 000, in Romania by fines of between EUR 155 000 and EUR 6 666, and in Bulgaria by fines of between EUR 125 000 and EUR 7 500.

A Norwegian armoured battalion participated in NATO exercises in the most remote and hostile areas
Soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces participated in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the capital, Oslo.
It is part of the NATO exercise Triple Junction 2018, the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the soldiers from the 2nd Battalion of the Norwegian Armed Forces after the 9/11 terrorist attacks spent a lot of time away from home, in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries.
But most of all, they are skilled in Arctic warfare, and their skills are especially useful now that NATO is shifting its focus.
For the past few days, in the mountains east of Tyneside, often in the most remote and inhospitable terrain, soldiers have been engaged in mock battles against real British soldiers.
The soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold wilderness, but in the harsh climate, they have to carry a much heavier load - about 110 pounds [50 kg] per pack.
Soldiers stationed at the base say that they share their survival and fighting skills with other NATO troops.
Soldiers say that this exercise, which is more like real warfare than any other, will train them to be ready if a serious threat arises.

Vice-mayor of Kaunas does not plan to return to politics
Former Kaunas vice mayor Povilas Mačiulis, who left his job in the municipality and the "Unified Kaunas" organization to support Vygaudas Ušackas in the presidential election, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
"I'm going to concentrate on business.
I'm a shareholder in several companies, and I also have ideas for new projects.
Most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with my family", Mačiulis told BNS.
He also said he had no plans to run in the upcoming municipal elections.
Mačiulis has not yet had a chance to speak with Ušack after he lost the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union primary to Ingrida Šimonytė on Sunday.
"To be honest, we haven't had the chance to discuss the results and future plans with him and his team yet.
It is obvious that with Vygaudas' withdrawal from further election campaigning, this stage of my life is over", said P. Mačiulis.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas politics because of support for V. Ušackas, only regretted that "Lithuania lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations".
P. Mačiulis briefly served as deputy mayor of Kaunas in 2011, and later returned to this position after the successful "United Kaunas" elections in 2015.
He's a shareholder in a private school, the Erudite Lyceum, and several other companies.
Workers at Kaunas Castle: What Are They Doing Here?
When the people of Kaunas noticed the hardworking workers at Kaunas Castle, they hoped that the remaining tower was finally being restored.
The director of the Kaunas City Museum, Gabrielius Sužiedėlis, told the portal kauno.diena.lt that the roofing of the southwestern tower with a fragment of the defensive wall is being replaced.
According to the source, the roofs will be made of tin.
'The corrosion of the emergency canopy posed a risk of falling and injury, and it was necessary to replace it.
The roofs were no longer waterproof, so the heritage was also damaged", explained the museum director.
Will the roofs be similar to those of a few centuries ago?
"All the work is coordinated with the heritage and other institutions", adds G. Sužeidėlis, in order to make the result as authentic as possible.
A versatile solution for working with heritage.
Before that, the elements of the Kaunas castle were covered with tarpaulin during the Soviet era, so they no longer had any historical value", explained the director of the Kaunas City Museum.
The work contract was signed on 2 October.
The work is expected to take no more than three months from the date of signature of the contract.
"It is hoped that it will be completed by the end of November", said the museum director.
According to him, the value of the works amounted to almost EUR 24000.
This amount, according to the interlocutor, was foreseen in this year's budget.
The works at Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company Statia.
Kauno. diena.lt has written how, according to research, Kaunas Castle could have appeared earlier.
The United States and South Korea have resumed naval exercises.
A two-week naval drill involving about 500 troops will now take place in the southern city of Pohang, Seoul's Defense Ministry announced.
There are 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.
The two countries have been holding joint military exercises for years, which Pyongyang calls "provocation" and "preparation for invasion".
On Friday, North Korea threatened to restart its nuclear program unless Washington lifted economic sanctions on Pyongyang.
Such a change of course could be "seriously considered", said the North Korean Foreign Ministry.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a television interview that the sanctions would remain in place until Pyongyang gave up its nuclear weapons.
He also announced that he would meet North Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol in New York this week.

The Centre for Eastern European Studies will cooperate with two prominent US think tanks
According to Lino Kojala, head of RESC, which is based in Vilnius and has been operating for thirteen years, establishing a network in the US will allow projects to be implemented and make Lithuania's voice more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
'We have been working towards this goal for several months.
I am pleased that two major institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities to work together.
I have no doubt that there will be niches for activities, as the topics we are analysing - NATO, security, disinformation, the development of the Eastern Partnership countries - are also priorities for them,' said Kojala.
The agreements specify that the RESC and the US authorities will work together on the preparation of international project applications, exchange of expertise and knowledge, and expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have excellent international reputations.
The FPRI has been in existence since 1955 and brings together nearly a hundred top-level analysts.
FPRI was ranked seventh in its category in the latest global ranking of think tanks by the University of Pennsylvania.
Meanwhile, CEPA, whose analysts have been repeatedly invited to advise and work in the highest US political institutions, is ranked 10th in its category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to break into the US information space and will encourage us to raise the quality bar", added Kojala.
One of the first practical steps should be for the partners to help disseminate the forthcoming RESC analytical publication Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review among US decision-makers and in the public domain.
The Centre for East European Studies operates on the basis of ongoing projects and is not supported by earmarked grants.
The RESC partners with which joint initiatives are implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international foundations, etc.
Two buildings collapsed in Marseilles
Two people were slightly injured when two buildings collapsed in the southern French city of Marseilles on Monday, according to the fire department.
As the buildings collapsed, debris streamed onto the street and clouds of dust rose.
Dozens of firefighters, some with dogs, were on the scene near Marseille's famous old port.
Photos posted on Twitter by the local prefecture showed piles of debris and wooden beams, a large gap where buildings had stood, firefighters working at the scene, and cars covered in a thick layer of dust.
Officials said they were searching for people who may have been trapped under the rubble.
Marseille firefighters tweeted that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
Amateur video footage broadcast by BFM-TV showed clouds of dust in the street and passersby with sleeves over their mouths.
Google Street View images taken before the incident show that one of the collapsed buildings was five stories and the other six.
One of these buildings was clearly in poor condition, with boarded-up windows and large cracks in the facade.
Sabine Bernasconi, the mayor of the Marseille district, said that one of the buildings was in poor condition and had been ordered to be evacuated.
However, the mayor could not rule out the possibility that the building might have been used by squatters.

Mexican restaurant helps migrants deported from the US
More and more Mexicans are being deported back, and they're having a hard time adjusting when they get back.
"When I was deported, they took everything - my house, my car, my clothes.
They took everything except one thing - my knowledge", says Victor Hugo Hernandez, the manager of the restaurant.
The restaurant hopes that the blending of Mexican and U.S. cultures will promote greater mutual understanding.
An Afghan Special Forces soldier shot an American instructor during a training exercise.
Brent Taylor, the 39-year-old mayor of North Ogden, just north of Salt Lake City, was on a year-long leave of absence to serve in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but he had to go back to work as mayor in January.
Another U.S. service member, whose name has not yet been released, was wounded in Saturday's attack that killed Taylor.
Officials say Taylor died from small-arms fire.
Major General Jefferson S. Burton, commander of the Utah National Guard, told reporters that Taylor helped train and build the capacity of the Afghan National Army.
Utah media quoted NATO as saying that Taylor was shot by a trained Special Forces soldier and that the gunman was killed by Afghan forces.
Mr. Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His remains are scheduled to be flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Monday evening.
He'd done two tours in Iraq, and this was his second tour in Afghanistan.
In January, prior to his deployment to Afghanistan, Taylor told local media that he had been assigned to an advisory and training team for a special forces battalion in that country.
Meanwhile, hundreds of North Ogden residents lined the streets of a city of about 17,000 to see off their mayor and his family in a police motorcade.
Taylor was elected mayor in 2013.
