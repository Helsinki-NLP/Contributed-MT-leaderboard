This not only confirms that pelomenes and some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has since been disproved, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The plumage of these animals is described as brownish above with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The findings also provide insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a highly developed shaft called the carapace, but had other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers deduced that the carapace was likely a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation.The researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not that of a chick.
Researchers have suggested that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not that of a chick.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday, killing two officers and injuring more than twenty others.
The governor's office said 19 of the injured were police officers.

They discovered that the sun operated according to the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars was determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but programs were written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and Milky Way matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy.
Scientists have found that dark matter interacts with dark matter in much the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around a type of halo, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters insulate themselves in a glass bubble, then place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter's book.
French electoral law codifies the procedure quite rigorously.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes were opened at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes were opened other than those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. At night, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, following specific procedures.

The document, according to the leaked information, refers to the border dispute, which the Palestinians claim is based on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem as a holy city for both nations and the issue of the Jordan River.
Israel demands continuous military detention in the valley for ten years, when an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow detention for only five years.
Shooters in supplementary pest control trials should be closely supervised by forest rangers, as trials are conducted and their effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Shooting Association's bridal programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Park Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received detailed instructions and safety training.
Martelly imposed yesterday a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of at least nine members.
It is Martelly's fourth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by allegations of widespread human rights violations, some of which date back to 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPods overheating and catching fire were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's reporting delays "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Emergency Management reported no damage in the country.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer holds Hong Kong tourists hostage when he seizes their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and several pilgrims have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and babies, were later released, along with the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers substituted for an elderly lady as she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland Maternity Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in her spare time.
His research has shown that if a hormone is administered, it accelerates fetal lung maturity.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Monday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Moon was the first Queen of the East. My first manager. Moon died in the night two moons. Very unique like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as special as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to a republic rose by 8 percent compared with 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled shared the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
According to the stark results of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist is due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three Commonwealth Games events, but her fitness is in doubt.
He is unable to take painkillers, which are forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets can potentially be sources of groundwater supplies along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially the formation of the earth, from the collision of comets thousands of years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and slander".
There is speculation that he may run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
It is possible that no other transport links below ground stop at Wembley and car parking and pick-up stations are not available above ground.
Rising transportation costs raised the possibility of games being forced behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to have taken much longer, due to interbreeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and a migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of objects.
It could be sewn into a fine thread, twisted or plaited, and hammered or rolled into shapes.
It could be made very thin, glued onto another metal, and was so fine that it was sometimes used to decorate illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the dpH of a chemical. It is possible to construct an indicator with the sum of the dew point.
The amount of lye changes color depending on how acidic or (alkaline) basic the product is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have exchanged electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Gather the two dry powders together and then, with clean, damp hands, squeeze them into balls.
The moisture in your mouth reacts with the outer layer, which looks kind of strange and forms a kind of cone.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the ruins of Minoan Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Roman Empire, public baths often had separate areas for men and women.
When you make a phone call from thousands of miles away, you know how to use satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then reflects it back down almost instantaneously.
Telescopes in space are useful because the earth's atmosphere warps some of the light from our eyes.
It takes a huge rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is give us much easier and faster transportation.
We have trains, cars, and other means of transportation.
Their diet consists mostly of medium-sized elephants that eat medium-sized prey ranging from sheep to antelopes and voles.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of nesting, a special task that each cat has that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
Packs consist of one to three adult male family members, along with up to thirty females and young.
Usually the women are closely related to each other, forming extended families of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions act much like packs of wolves or dogs, they are surprisingly lion-like animals (but not as large as other big cats) in behavior, and also quite murderous with their prey.
Like a well-trained athlete, the tiger can run (but not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with a force five times that of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not a full-throated roar like that of a lion, but is more like a series of loud, piercing grunts.
The jaguar prefers to eat small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by scent.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily, too. Ocelots mate with their prey by blending into their environment and then jumping onto their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the original population (such as by moving over a mountain range or a river, or by moving to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they are often not very different from what they were before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than those needed before.
The original population has remained virtually unchanged, and its needs have not changed.
Over time, as new populations adapted to their new environments, they became less and less like other populations.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make food by photosynthesis and also provide shade.
Most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its day, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 teeth, with an extra set in the roof of the mouth to prevent escaping prey.
Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that moved in the water - even a giant dinosaur like T. rex.
While most of their food items are familiar to us, the Romans had their share of exotic or unusual feasts, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a kind of rodent called a partridge.
Another difference was that while the poor and the widow sat at tables together, the rich enjoyed associative gatherings at which they could sit together and enjoy food together.
The ancient Roman diet may not have included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, there were no tomatoes, potatoes, corn, or cacao, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built elaborate temples, which they viewed as the dwelling places of their many gods.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could go.
Special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, such a house would be modest.
Much of Hebrew family life revolved around the outdoors.
Women cooked in the open air; shops were little more than red-brick balconies overlooking the street.
In the land of Canaan, forests are scarce and timber is expensive.
Greenland was very sparsely settled. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red, exiled from Iceland for murder, and while travelling west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Whatever the case, the Scythians were already there.
Although the entire country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think of a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not the case, for although a handwritten document is a storehouse of information, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed along the bottom of the document, from top to bottom, were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, this large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
However, it is likely that the notation was coined simply as a label.
While the D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, much of the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fight them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France, began.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a significant group of people living and working cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civilis, meaning city, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also defines, in some form, the dimensions of society.
City-states are precursors to nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, a comprehensive cultural heritage, and equitable sharing.
Small cultures often disappear without relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a loose central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, depended on often uncooperative state officials to enforce its acts.
It also lacked the authority to nullify laws and tax tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended and the states did not bind the central government in such a way that its representatives were almost entirely silent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, are the second most successful national teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to, rather than its geographical location, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese labourers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three major structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the top of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues today.
For example, the world's most common still image photography format is 35mm, which was the dominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but, more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually somewhat confusing, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are the same or very close in aspect ratio.
The most abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining at the same time a measure of unimagined order.
He states that the most effective location for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown rich and powerful, came under attack.
For more than a thousand years, European nations were united by Christianity despite differences in language and culture.
Its awesome power affects everyone, from kings to common people.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain instituted a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violates generally accepted international law, codified by numerous international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to deny access to all sections of the ocean, endangering neutral shipping.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors of war during World War I, nations resolved to avoid such atrocities in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former business manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each Chinese stage or ruling dynasty was a different dynasty.
Also within each dynasty was an unstable series of divided provinces, the most famous of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During the period of turmoil, there were violent struggles between various nobles for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for supremacy over the great palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belonged to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution occupations were open to all male candidates in order to allow the most ambitious and well-off to succeed.
The same applies to troops because instead of troop ratings being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired repressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave known as "Hira" in the "Noor" (Light) Mountains for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived many centuries, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, they are not easy to find, even if they are known to exist.
Nothing can be seen but the beautiful clear sky above and the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many huge pyramid structures built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The "arc up" sign looks like a V and the "arc down" sign looks like a staple or a square without its bottom edge.
Upward means that you should start by pointing and drawing the bow, and downward means that you should start from the middle (which is where your opponent catches the bow) and draw the bow.
An upstroke generally produces a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more assertive.
You are welcome to make your mark in pencil, but note that printed score markings are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, all terrified, were forced by an angry mob to return from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789.
Surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the King and Queen, they traveled back to Paris in a covered wagon.
The mob forced the king and queen to roll up the windows of their carriage.
Recently, a member of the mob decapitated a royal guard at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on the bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploration of the Philippine people constituted the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one needs to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Late Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a vast range of ideas in practice, from the technological drive or technological imperative to the narrow sense that human distinctiveness is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and the manifestation of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on society that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, people may say that the automobile necessarily led to better roads.
However, a national highway network is not economically viable for cars alone, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning cars.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in health care to repair damaged organs.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to this geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is considered the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with goods such as silks and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height in the period between the 10th - 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of the slowness of communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own styles. One of the major developments of the era, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons for sewing clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced for the production of just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses native seeds from preserved ecosystems along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures frequently signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashions, mannerisms, and clothing.
One of the most common methods used to describe the importance of socialization is to take advantage of the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults when they were growing up.
Some feral children have been confined by humans (usually by their own country); in some cases, abandonment of such children has occurred due to the country's rejection of the severity of a child's intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have suffered abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others are allegedly raised by animals; some are said to live in the wild for self-preservation.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of particular pets, such as fear or indifference toward living beings.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, attendance goes a step further.
Assistive technology is not a method of learning, but rather an aid that provides support for individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using computer software or starting a new project.
Attendance can be both virtual and real, i.e. a teacher is one form of attendance, but so is the paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants are embedded in software and are used to ask questions, suggest and explain procedures that may have been challenging for a learner to handle on their own.
Children may be placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even rape.
Children should never have to grow up in an environment that is not welcoming, caring and nurturing, however they grow.
We realized that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care systems should provide safe homes, loving care, stable childcare, and reliable health care.
The family budget should take into account any needs that have not yet been met locally.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and approaches to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"'People involvement'" and "'relationship continuity'" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audiences' interactions with websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that lying ability can be determined by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "Presidential Speech", pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are usually able to evaluate sincerity and accuracy.
He even suggested that these abilities in interpreting human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: recessive and active.
Mutations increase new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination swap back-and-forth variation between the two groups with each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Failure to do so can result in serious consequences, including stunted growth, malnutrition, and even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, mushrooms, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
After all, it should not be surprising that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that modern savannah chimpanzees do.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally remembering during your normal sleep period and going to sleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you without fully awakening you.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during the sound, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get up and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces people to wake up to pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated to the amount of stress in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is perceived. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been extended to the Mahayana path of love and to various techniques of Indian Yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple, consisting of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of total love.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of Divinity. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and light consciousness is raised.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
With the end of both wars, the former Allies were enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for nearly 40 years and be fought in earnest, by proxy, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish fire had been extinguished, and the only hope was to regroup in western Romania.
However, this plan was abolished almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army crossed the Belarusian and Ukrainian borders after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of cargo ships is arguably the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's job has always been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and assets, while at the same time, it interferes with your enemy's ability to move its people and assets.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the United States was attempting to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was stepping up its use of U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Iron Age Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes bred them to facilitate access to milk, hair, meat and fur.
Domestic goats were usually raised on hillsides and other grazing areas, often by goatherds who were often children or adolescents, as were the better-known stockmen.
Caravans first appeared in England in the early 16th century.
Although the chariots were only made of planks of wood on each side, horses could pull them to reach greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had iron supports on top.
This became common practice, as more iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767, the first complete iron coaches were introduced.
The earliest known transport was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, while Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become activists ourselves, in order to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like a symptomatic treatment in many cases, so if we can't create a temporary solution, then we should look for the root of the problem, and we should deactivate it.
It is obvious that the world has changed greatly as a result of human scientific and technological advances, not to mention the problems of overpopulation and an unbalanced life-style.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten proposal signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printer, a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies of The Finished Mystery were produced overnight.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
An order to Washington on July 6 was read to the troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 surviving copies of the Dunlap broadsides are the oldest known surviving copies of this document.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs escaped and are alive today.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they fly.
Yet, there is still much to learn about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, namely 1 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible.Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The most common indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open wound or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in no formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Killer Whales and Kama Whales are brood parasites, adapted to live in the nests or homes of married females.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Researchers have found that females are twice as likely as males to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests - or in the best interests of their children - to have a baby.
The couple may choose to adopt a child.
In an arranged marriage, the biological parent relinquishes his or her parental rights so that the child's other parent can care for the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, which guides most scientific inquiry.
Furthermore, experiments, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West became isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and cognition depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue a freely cycling period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
In two experiments, they labeled either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of appreciating the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning about ecosystems.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borno.
Every morning, people leave their small rural communities by car to go to their places of work, passing other people whose workplace is just down the street.
With the advent of dynamic transportation, everyone is in some way connected to a transportation system based on individual cars, which supports them.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Most people complain about transportation systems.
You don't often hear similar levels of complaints about poor water quality or collapsing bridges in developed countries.
Is it simply incompetence on the part of transportation engineers, or is something more fundamental at work?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of vehicle drivers between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with any sense of certainty.
Philosophically, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relations help in the planning, concession and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more quickly and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over the body.
This gives them a greater variety of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only wingless insects are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, Aristarchus of Samos proposed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
While some people believed that he was correct, most believed the opposite - that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and the other stars themselves).
That seems reasonable, since the earth appears to be stationary, does it not?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the next-largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's longest river, measuring some ten thousand miles in width.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 3,980 miles (6,387 km) long and is fed by thousands of tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Bedouin Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and in the technical sophistication of their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom looked with awe upon the monuments of their predecessors, more than a thousand years older.
The population of Vatican City is just over 800, making it the world's smallest independent state and least densely populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most civil servants, while Latin is often used in religious services.
Vatican City is almost entirely Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, because they can all be discovered in nature natively and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
Greek philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form the things we see.
Remember, alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You may also have alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny particles that are billions of times smaller than the period at the end of a sentence.
The pencil, however, proved to be a useful tool in its early days.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to lower status and use.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever touching a screen.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
Fission bombs work on the principle that inertia is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a hot coal up a hill, splitting the nucleus again, and then releasing some of the inertia.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no decay.
The Moon's surface is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the near side and 100 km thick at the far side.
It is thinner below sea level and thicker above high ground.
There may be more marshland nearby because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on discovering what makes people tick or attract them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what it is about certain people that causes them to do the things they do and what it is about their environment that causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two attitudes can arise when judges begin to dominate their former colleagues: One extreme is to try to remain "one of the guys".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility to people.
At the other end of the spectrum, people transform into unrecognizable individuals who feel they must change everything the team has ever done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there is a subtle difference.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for your immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than less conventional team members, as their teams can meet according to variable schedules that may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports.
Why does an organization go through this lengthy process of creating a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and commitment can flourish.
As a result, an organization's processes that work together to overcome obstacles can lead to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as the sharing of organizational knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method that is used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, thereby narrowing the field and making it more precise.
Correlations between brain pathology and behavior support scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of material with which to construct simulation models that help us understand mental processes.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
AI research involves designing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being featured in many home computers and video game software.
Field trips are a big part of any class. Often a teacher would like to take their students to a place where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers solutions with virtual classroom tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a study tour is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol, and each year the website is redesigned, with older versions kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience often changes that.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, bloggers have begun efforts to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed the public's interest inspires students to be creative and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend mutual learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical; through active response to Internet material, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings, as well as shape their own perspectives on particular issues"" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city and features a variety of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more distinguish Ontario from what is considered purely Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited desert.
For a population comparison, this is surprising to many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent unto itself when it comes to avoiding jungle.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it had a major influence in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler state that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
Wearing a wedding ring (though not an expensive one) can also be helpful.
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may consider as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, hugged, etc.
Be firm in saying yes, and do not be afraid to stand your ground.
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, ceramics, crockery, hooks, and all kinds of trinkets, mostly for tourists.
Goma is a resort city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano that burned most of the city, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing war situation in North Kivu province.
The town is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for short trips.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu"" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, though its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to encroaching desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS Wonderful World of Africa special.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has more of an Arabian than African theme.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and park entrance fees.
It may also be useful to purchase a Park Pass, which allows entry into either selected parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is where many tourists consider the main focus.
The rows of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been compared to a grid of gently sloping reefs jutting into Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite side of Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely populated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British settlers made their home and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove coastal belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the Indian coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remnants of the great forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and close to 30,000 leopards sighted in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are almost always full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster brand buses, which are reliable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable means of travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 272 feet (83 m), have a diameter of 1,250 feet (378 m), and have two runways each 12 feet (3.5 m) wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011 and the bridge opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in what is today Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called the "Giant Province of the Indies", emerged as a result of encounters between Spanish conquistadors and native Indian groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The main tournament of the year takes place in June at the Las Cañitas polo grounds.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Cash can be withdrawn at the islands' only bank which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
In outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check beforehand with landlords to find out what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Malvinas currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, it experiences summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, and wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There is no specific "wet" and "dry" season: the amount of rain remains the same throughout the year.
Although many park animals are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is, however, wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, the monkeys were kept within 330 feet [100 m] of bears and wolves and within 80 feet [25 m] of other wildlife!
No matter how tame they may seem, bison, deer, elk, bears, and almost any other large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a safe distance from these large, ferocious, and potentially dangerous animals.
Also, be aware that deer attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid transporting or cooking deer food and keep campgrounds clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a famous naval engagement in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain left port.
All but one of the British cruisers were destroyed, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the location of Auckland's two harbours.
The north coast beaches (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are often crowded family beaches with a good variety of shops lining the shore.
The main local dish is "Number One", which is not a full meal but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local dish is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but wines from New Zealand and Australia can travel better.
Tap water is perfectly safe for babies, but bottled water is easier to find if you have a tap.
To Australians, the idea of a "white coffee" is foreign; a short black is an "espresso", a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is made according to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
There are frequent trips to the reef throughout the year, and damage from any cause to the reef is rare.
Even so, accept the advice of the authorities, obey all traffic signs, and heed all safety warnings.
Jellyfish occur near the sea and near river estuaries from October to April in the northern 1770s and can sometimes be found out of season.
Sharks have existed for thousands of years, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with some hotels, although it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include coffee, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even flight and hotel packages together.
They may also hold your reservation if you need more time to think about the offer or to apply for other documents (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should be first routed through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to stay at the venue and most attendees consider it a vital part of their experience.
If you live close to the action, you may have to wander farther afield to find a seat close to the music.
Keep in mind that although the main stages may be sold out, festival sessions may run late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you know you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as crossing the ice creates extreme noise for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include a stopover in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special offers of food, drinks and entertainment, to keep the guests happy, and to keep them in the establishment.
However, drunkenness impairs good judgment, and all responsible gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who knows how to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction and you cannot drive as smoothly as on paved roads.
During a snowstorm, enough snow may fall to enclose a prison cell for a short time.
Visibility may also be limited by snow drifts or by condensation or ice on the windshields.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's greatest tourist attraction and are enjoyed by many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland travel to view the spectacular African wildlife particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach close to vehicles and standard equipment allows good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are somewhat shy, and they are best seen with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk, bushwalk, or bushwalk) consists of hiking, either for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flight tickets for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not go into effect until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were rescheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have both a drying rack and a drying table that are ready for use when guests are not in the room.
If a sharp iron is not available, or if you do not like using sharp tools, then you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the tissue (causing shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burns).
Different forms of water purification exist, some more effective against specific asbestos.
In some areas, one minute of boiling is sufficient; in others, several minutes may be needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and some have safety concerns, so you should consider getting your filters fitted by a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to them in their regions of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, more rarely, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can infect or kill humans, are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods without taxes and special consumption taxes in certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, which often passes through isolated bush country.
If you are not used to driving on the open road, beware: There are many steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on previous and subsequent sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, though, cell phone coverage is much stronger here than in many parts of the country, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is very good, and in Bavaria it is very rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbour, Austria.
Doses of fruit are common, such as doses made of apples throughout the year, and of cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many products of German cuisine are also flavoured with almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you create some richer desserts, try experimenting with some regional varieties, such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a single dish of aromatic herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A meal may be either "wet" or "dry", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originating from the central part of the main island, Java.
Although available to all classes throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a variety of simple seasoned dishes, of which the predominant flavors preferred by Javanese are mankara, malgeta, sugar (especially sugar from the Javanese kok) and various aromatic spices.
A stirrup is a footrest attached to either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider as they can have safety boxes divided to reduce the chance of a rider's foot getting caught in them.
To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with flat, narrow heels.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a rider's harness to be released from the saddle if pulled back by a falling horse.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's main climbing area, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and crevices.
The summits include breathtaking views from the peaks, and climbers from all over the world are creating new routes through its endless potential of walls.
Snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with large numbers of enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", who plan entire vacations to return from skiing at undetermined locations.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Adventurous skiing: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, hiking, or ski touring.
It is related to, but does not usually involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of ski trails as parallel hiking trails.
Under the right conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than you can on foot - much less cross-country skiing speeds without a backpack strapped to your back on groomed trails.
Europe is a fairly small continent, mostly consisting of many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling to many countries means that you have to go through many visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, on the other hand, functions somewhat like a country in itself.
Once there, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Also, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each non-Schengen country, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques; some tax agencies define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
This definition has geographic variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as the United States than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be called antiques, although they are more recent than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence among the Sámi and cultural and commercial reindeer herding is also important for other professions.
While traditionally, though, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale farming, most have lived from fishing, hunting and the like, with reindeer primarily as pack animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern offices, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi.
Although widely used, especially among Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments besides your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may experience different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The poll is merely a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any hazardous meteorological phenomenon with the potential to cause widespread destruction, severe social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and different types of climate exist, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rain, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include snow, blizzards, ice storms, and hailstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions affecting their area, as it may affect any travel plans.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that might otherwise be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "green building courses" will likely yield the address of a local business.
A course usually covers all of the above topics in greater detail, usually with practical experience.
A course typically lasts 2-5 days and involves dramatization, extensive first aid training and, occasionally, weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness abound, but there is little literature about war zones.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they carry valid documentation for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to emulate passports with undeclared gender (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor the document is also variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-operative transsexual people should not expect to undergo scans without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the return flows of waves breaking on the sea, often not on reefs or similar places.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast current to deep water can form tears.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue while swimming upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you are out of the current, getting back in is no longer a problem.
Try to swim to a place where you won't be caught again or, depending on your skill and noticeableness, you can create a rescue pool.
Re-entry shock occurs more slowly than culture shock (there are fewer honeymoon phases), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to new cultures often have particular difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
By the time you return to your home country after living abroad, you may have lost much of your cultural identity.
When you first arrived in a new land, the local people were likely very patient and understanding.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed by travelers who return home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the area's most popular attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the background and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
The sound and light show is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is depicted as a spinning top and the narrator of a long story.
Signs are hung on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of bases, with seventeen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km (75 mi) north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the creation of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula rise on the plateau, then collapse to form the 225-mile (360 km) chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, broken by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, with a peak of 4,892 m (16,000 ft) at Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without mobile-phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not generally a replacement for a mobile phone, as one must be within clear line of sight of the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is widely used for transportation, including leisure craft, as well as industries that require data and voice over long distances.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to tell you how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among high school dropouts, as it allows them to take a year off before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of returning to higher education in your home country.
There is usually a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" is also home to thousands of islands, lakes, and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos off the coast and the larger lakes are in fact large enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, most of the rest quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruise ships make an extended layover in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days before returning and sleeping on the boat overnight.
If you only go ashore on cruise ships you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise lines feature Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and city views are not included in the cruise price list.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of; it is just a normal fear or aversion that people have.
For some, an understanding of how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear of the unknown or of being out of control.
Express courier companies are cost-effective because they deliver goods quickly, often with little time for commercial documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger carriers have their own aircraft, but for other routes and for smaller carriers there was a problem.
If goods were sent by air, some routes could take days to clear customs.
The only way to speed up the process was to send it as checked baggage, which airline regulations prohibit.
The obvious way to travel first or business class is to pay handsomely for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough general rule, one can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it is not worth looking for discounts on exclusive or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of a quick and comfortable ride, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member states.
Economic relations were re-established between the two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the predominant religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest seaport after Istanbul, and a major transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and bustling center, situated on a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Broad avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets, and old mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard are interesting marble sculptures of tombs.
It takes about half an hour to walk through this picturesque village.
To the north and easily accessible is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, made famous to foreigners after a glowing account of its splendors recorded by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the huge Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (Shrine), a world-famous Marian apparition site.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site, and also a site of almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still men and women alive who survived their time, and many others, both Jews and non-Jews, who were injured, murdered, or worked to death.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not deface the site by marking or spraying graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are made almost exclusively in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are made by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is still to behave as if you are "bien élevé" (well brought up).
The gruff appearance of Parisians quickly evaporates if you learn a few basic courtesies.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and pine trees, and has a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a wide variety of plant communities, due to their varied microclimates, different soils and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, kuruja, lynx, wildcat and tetrazzini can be found here, along with many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders as well.
Most samples provide cover for the missing women, but if you bring yours, especially with a clear heart, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each wear, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on chicken, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A popular simple dinner, especially during summer, is Pa amb Oli: Chicken with vinegar, tomatoes and any available condiments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
They are a crude way of distinguishing between some verbs and compliments.
It also facilitates reading, although writing is complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or an adjective is used in the same way as a noun.
Pronunciation is very easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters are carefully distinguished as c and g, since pronunciation varies based on the following vowel.
Also, don't forget to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means expensive, while carro means car.
Persian has a relatively simple and almost always regular grammar.
However, reading this grammar booklet will help you to learn Persian grammar and to understand basic sentences better.
Needless to say, knowing a Romance language makes learning English easier.
However, people who understand some Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is sufficiently similar that it does not need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and have been converted into museums, or places of learning.
As light pollution in their heyday was not the kind of problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are small installations in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy returning from the Imperial Court.
Plants are at their best when out of their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" sample.
If you visit a formally landscaped garden, picking up "specimens" will also get you kicked out without a fight.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
Furthermore, being located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).

Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays, and it is celebrated as the date of Jesus' birth.
Many traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in both Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
Traditionally, on Easter night, watchmen stand on the north side of the tower to watch the sunrise.
Of course there were Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it was most likely a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility rite.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with congregations often breaking into celebrations around midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
Animals that first arrive on the islands either swim, dive, or swim.
Because of the distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galápagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the northern lights, since the sky is dark for about 24 hours a day.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you can appreciate the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address one another by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, and group efforts should be emphasized rather than individual achievements.
Employees must often win the approval of their superiors for any decision they make, and they are expected to follow their instructions implicitly.
