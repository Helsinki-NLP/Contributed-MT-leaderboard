Nike not only asserts that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widespread theory, but provides details not generally found in fossils, such as coloration and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists describe the feathers as brownish-brown on the upper side and dark brown or carotenoid on the underside.
The findings also provide insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
So dinosaur feathers did not have a rigid shaft called a rachis, but they did have other feather functions, such as fur and Researchers concluded that the rachis evolved independently from other feather functions.
The structure of the feathers suggests that the feathers could not have been used in flight except for temperature regulation or display.
The researchers suggested that, although these were the skeletons of juvenile dinosaurs, the samples showed adult feathers and not juveniles.

Shooters involved in pest control trials must be supervised by a supervisor, as the experiment is ongoing and its effectiveness is evaluated.
Working together within the NPWS and the Incorporated Shooting Sport Association of Australia involves volunteers being re-qualified into the sniper program under the Shooting Sport Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Preservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters were trained with comprehensive safety re-shooting operations and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in as the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council yesterday.
It was Martelly's fifth time serving on the Provisional Electoral Council in 4 years.
The following month, a presidential commission recommended that the CEP chairman resign as a measure to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests have been marred by alleged election irregularities, some of which date back to 2011.
At least 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods becoming seriously ill have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), stated that it was aware of 27 accidents due to the device.
Last week, METI suggested that Apple had tampered with the information because 34 of these crashes were "not suspicious".
The minister called the response to Apple's stalling report "absolutely ridiculous".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (Friday 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management office confirmed that no damage had been reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also felt that there was no tsunami warning.
A former Filipino policeman kidnaps Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.

Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, including the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then moved on to the scene of an elderly woman reaching for a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She had trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
Their research suggests that administering hormones may accelerate fetal lung maturation.

Of the 1400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, those who favoured Australia as a republic received 8 percent more than in 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard's supporters argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed said they would prefer Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
At the other extreme, 29 percent of those polled felt that Australia should become a republic in the near future while 31 percent thought Australia should never become a republic.
Olympic gold medalists will swim in the 100-metre and 200-metre freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints, they will be disqualified.
He was unable to get the medication he needed to treat his pain but his medication was banned from the gym.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has proved that there are infinitely many primes on this day, January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was released on Boxing Day.
Comets may have originally delivered water to Earth along with natural materials that could have formed proteins and supported life on Earth.
Scientists are interested in understanding how the planets formed, especially how the Earth formed as a result of comets colliding with the Earth over long periods of time.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described hate speech as "political and ungodly".
He plans to run for President in the 2016 election.
NextGen is the only system that the FAA says will allow its aircraft to fly fewer routes while saving millions of gallons of fuel per year and avoiding carbon emissions.
It uses advanced satellite technology over existing ground-based radar technology, enabling ATC to locate its aircraft in the correct position and provide pilots with accurate information.
There is now no vehicular traffic and the subway does not stop at Wembley, and car parking facilities and playgrounds are not available on the grounds.
It was feared that with limited transportation the games would be held indoors without spectators supporting the team.
A study published last week in the Journal of Science reports that a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos has been discovered.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species evolve in two generations, a process that probably takes a long time, based on the evolution of Darwin's endemic fungus, Geospiza fortes, and the cactus immigrant fungus, Geospiza conitostris.
Gold can be made in many shapes and sizes.
It can be woven into thin wire, rolled and folded, and hammered or rolled into paper.
The gold could be made very thin and attached to other metals; it was sometimes used to decorate the hand paintings of books in the so-called "holy manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicative of the amount of hydrogen ions (H at pH) of the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have electrons exchanged (a hydrogen atom contains one proton and one electron).
Take two measures of fine flour, knead them together, and use five cups of steamed flour to form a ball.
His fingers would touch the sides of the cover which would make them look funny and shell-shaped.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in private homes, connected by a simple sewer system.
Complex sewage systems have been excavated from Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Egypt.
It was also used as a toilet by the ancient Egyptians, Persians and Chinese.
When they want to call someone who is miles away, they use satellites.
Satellites in outer space receive the signal and relay it back to Earth in real time.
Satellites are launched into space using rockets.Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere reflects some of the light and scenery.
It uses rockets more than 100 feet in diameter to launch satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheels have transformed the world from a dirt road. The advantage of large wheels for everyone is that transportation is now easier and faster.
The wheel has inspired trains, automobiles, and other forms of transportation.
Below them are many medium-sized rodents that feed on medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are many smaller fungi (including the parasitic fungi), which feed on a variety of small prey such as insects, frogs, lizards and birds.
The essence of architecture is perhaps the concept of a place, a special work of art that has its own architecture so that the architecture is never in conflict.
Lions are among the most social of mammals, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three adult male lions of equal size, accompanied by up to thirty females and their cubs.
Females are typically closely related, forming extended families with sisters and daughters.
Pride lions behave like packs of wolves or hyenas, predators look like lions (but not necessarily other big cats) in their behaviour, and have a lethal appetite for their prey.
An athlete of great skill, the tiger could kick (though not very well), block, jump long distances and lift five times the weight of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the lion was like the roar of a lion, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.
He likes to eat small animals. He catches mice, snakes, rats, and squirrels. All the animals that the octopuses eat are far away from him.
Scientists think that ocelots hunt and find animals by scent, sniffing out where they are on the ground.
They feed best at night, wear dark clothing, and move about stealthily. Ocelots consume their prey by stirring up the environment and by stalking prey.
When a small group of organisms (a population) becomes separated from its original main population (such as if it moves to a new mountain or river, or if it moves to a new island where it cannot survive) it will often find itself in an environment that is different from where it was before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different traits or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than what was originally required.
The original populations have not changed in the slightest, they are still subject to the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to new environments, they begin to look more and more different from other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of a new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (exhale).
Plants make their food from sunlight through photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurs were apex predators during the season, so they were not dependent on anything other than other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws contain more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, with dental assets attached to the roof of its mouth, which means there is no exit for anything that passes through its path.
We don't know for sure, but his tongue was probably forked. His father was a crocodile, a large fish, another reptile, and he was probably a cannibal.
They also attacked anything that fell into the water; it is thought that large dinosaurs such as T. rex were unable to compete.
While much of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had some truly divine or unusual foods, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of mouse called the dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their meals while sitting on couches, while the men preferred to eat together where they had a lounge next to them while they ate.
The cuisine of ancient Rome cannot be separated from that which came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or chocolate, and no Romans ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians built temples to their gods that were called the houses of the gods.
They would bring offerings to the gods and the priests would try to please the gods through rituals and festivals.
A tabernacle is set up. In its first room are the priests who enter the Most Holy Place.
Here a special pyramid-shaped tower, called a ziggurat, was built as part of the temple.
At the top of the tower was a shrine to the god.
In the warm climates of the Middle East, houses were especially important.
Much of Jewish family life took place in brightly lit rooms.
Women sleep outside; the only storage is an open counter facing the street. The stones are used to build houses.
There were no forests in the land, so trees were scarce.
Greenland is only partially inhabited. The Norse Sagas state that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and that on his westward journey, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite the excavation, Eskimos have lived there ever since.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences in the people, monarchs, dress, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If he had seen the film National Treasure, he might have thought of the treasure map inscribed on the left side of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the left side of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
While no one knows for sure who wrote them, it is known that early on, most large parchment documents (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) were simply rolled up for storage.
Thus, it is possible that the clause was added merely as a label.
The D-Day landings and the allies involved had liberated northern France, but not the south.
It was dictated by "Vichy" France. Only the French had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers against their will.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way back to Germany.
A civilization is a culture that is characterized by large groups of people living and working together, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town-state, and it also emphasizes the size of the community.
The city-state is the beginning of the nation-state. Civilizations are characterized by the transmission of knowledge across generations, the persistence of cultural traces, and their equitable distribution.
Subsistence cultures gradually disappeared without leaving sufficient historical evidence for them to be classified as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states formed a central government - with Congress only as their component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all their laws.
Nor does it have the authority to set the country's tax laws and rates.
The article required the unanimous consent of all states before an amendment could be ratified and states undermined the central government if their representatives did not regularly attend.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern Hemisphere, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of over 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster of Japanese islands, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipelago".
The last mention of Taiwan was in the 15th century when European sailors travelling overseas recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, saw a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and recruited Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1904-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu had three main structures, the Inihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the beach complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they look like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues today.
For example, the still image photography format most commonly used in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
These are still produced today, but more importantly the aspect ratios have been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The original 35mm format was, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the smallest integer ratio) may be expressed as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family for example) match or approach these aspect ratios.
The widely abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that encourages dynamism and maintains proper size for your images.
This suggests that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see their example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, gained prominence.
For over a thousand years Christianity had bound the nations of Europe together despite differences in language and culture.
Wisdom rules over all, from king to commoner.
One of the main tenets of Christianity was that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary income should be used for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had existed in Rome for over a thousand years and this centralization of power and money led many to question whether this principle had been compromised.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, the British instituted a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade is a violation of the generally accepted international law codified by various peers over the last two centuries.
The British dredged international rivers to prevent ships from entering their waters, posing a danger even to neutral shipping.
While there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany faced a similar response from its unrestricted submarine warfare.
By the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of the majority of the population and the country spoke of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war in World War I, countries were willing to tolerate such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison company in New York City.
They arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents in their pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (their manager at their previous jobs) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each part of China and ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
While each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces, the most notable of these periods were the three 60-year Epochs for the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period fierce battles were fought between various nobles who struggled for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history.
There were many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to Republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state was owned by a single ruler.
It was only after the revolution that jobs became open to all male applicants that the most ambitious and successful had a chance to succeed.
The same was true for the military as instead of troop rankings being based on class, they were now based on Childaber.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad enjoyed the luxuries of this worldly life; he frequently visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (sun) for contemplation.
They themselves, having survived the ordeal, provide the clearest image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Situated atop a mountain in the vicinity of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
However, it is not easy to find them if you know where they are; once in the cave, it is total isolation.
There is nothing to see except the clear blue sky and the many mountains around, and only a small part of the earth can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures built to house deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to please Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to please Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward" indicator looks like a 'V' and the "downward" indicator looks like a flat box with a bottom.
Going up meant he would have to shoot over the top and under the bow; going down meant he would have to shoot under the bow (where he put his finger) and over the bow.
The upturned bow usually produces a softer sound, while the curved bow produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Feel free to use a pencil to sign yourself, but remember that the subject lines are there for the sake of the song, so they should usually be allowed.
The frightened King XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by some of the women of the court.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by cheering crowds shouting threats against the King and Queen.
Some force the king and queen to open wide the gates.
During the war, King Agamemnon married one of the daughters of a priest of Apollo who led a revolt against the Trojans.
The money used for the imperialist war in the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States for the purpose of financing expenditures and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street Banking Houses.
Certainly, the superprofits derived from the relentless exploitation of the Filipino people were a fundamental benefit of United States imperialism.
To understand the 'Templars' they needed to understand the context that caused the riot.
The age in which this took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by convention around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of views in practice, ranging from a technological drive or technological imperative to a narrower notion that human behavior is driven by unconscious biases associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common assumptions: that technological developments themselves lead to more meaningful outcomes independent of cultural or political influences, and that technologies will have "effects" on the society in which they are applied, rather than on socially conditioned societies.
For example, it could be argued that the motor car was a consequence of the development of the highway.
However, the national road network was not economically viable with only a few cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of owning cars.
Mass car ownership also led to an increased incidence of road accidents, which led to the discovery of new techniques in health care to repair damaged organs.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, derived from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, people were confined by geography, and customs and cultural timelines associated with geography emerged and these corresponded to societal spaces, rather than forced and mobile boundaries.
While Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It flourished as a prosperous center beginning about 400 AD and continuing until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined over the next twelve centuries as crusaders returned home with gifts of silks and spices worth more than what the Byzantine market could bear.
It was during this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period of the 10th to 11th centuries and the 14th century.
It was preceded by notable Byzantine cultural influences in the east.
However, despite the different channels of communication, the trend in the West can be traced back 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages Western Europe saw the development of its own styles. One of the greatest of these developments was the result of the Crusades using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted for the production of food that meets the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a relatively recent system, purely organic, using seeds native to an 'ecoregion' in combination with crop rotation or other relatively recent techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in developing countries.
Subcultures recognize like-minded individuals who feel excluded by social norms and encourage them to develop a sense of belonging.
Subcultures may be diverse in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often mark their membership with distinctive and symbolic styles, which may include fashions, practices, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is that in many cases the less fortunate, the excluded, the suffering, or those who experience deliberate abuse, are not socialized by both children and adults as they grow into adults.
Such children are referred to as "feral". Some feral children have been confined by humans (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment is due to parental rejection of a severely mentally or physically disabled child.
Feral children may experience severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to live in the wild.
When raised by animals, feral children often behave like animals that are fearful or indifferent to humans.
Project-based learning, however, is supposed to make learning more productive and enjoyable, enabling children to learn more.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but an aid that provides support to individuals as they gain experience learning new skills such as using a new computer program or completing a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding or a small paperclip found in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized into the software and aims to remember, request, and communicate procedures that should challenge students to complete on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages for a variety of reasons including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment where they are not listened to, cared for, and educated, but they do.
We know that the foster care system should be a safe environment for the child.
Our entire care system should have safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and affordable health care.
It was necessary to provide for all the needs that could not be met at home before the children were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet allow for additional dimensions in terms of utility and gratification approaches.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" have been suggested as motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Self-actualization"" and ""continuous engagement"" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience behavior on websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of small, facial expressions made in milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that they can detect when people are deceiving themselves by misinterpreting true micro/micro expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, shows how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still judge sincerity accurately.
They also suggested that a similar ability to interpret human behavior could be exhibited by animals such as domestic cats.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of variation that is revealed.
Separate mixing variations and alternate recombination in the two lakes in each generation.
Returning to the Savanna, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to meet their amino acid needs from available food resources.
In addition, the risks of doing so have serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessed plant resources are proteins derived from seeds and nuts, but these are very difficult for primates such as monkeys to digest unless they are broken down.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they provide high quantities of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it seems not surprising that our own ancestors solved the "protein problem" in the same way that natural synapses still do today.
Sleep disruption is a process of deliberate awakening that occurs during the shortest period of normal sleep and wakefulness in adults (10-60 minutes).
This can be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake them up without disturbing them.
Perhaps he sensed that his brother was asleep, so he hid him in an alcove in the roof chamber and conspired to kill him.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing the person to urinate.
The degree of inner peace they achieve is inversely correlated with the amount of physical and mental stress they experience.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Individuals can attain enlightenment. The only thing that prevents this goal is tension and negativity within oneself.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhist teachings, but expanded upon by the Mahayana love branch and uses many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In the principles of Tibetan Buddhism it is Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the wave of love that is felt.
With Kundalini Yoga Kundalini energy (Energy of enlightenment) is developed using yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods. Through visualization of the gods, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the alliance with the Soviet Union and the United States.
Within two years of the war's end, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was in full swing.
It would be fought over the next four decades and would be fought virtually, by proxy forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Poland's defenses were exhausted, and its only hope was to reorganize along Romanian lines.
However, this plan was considered obsolete a decade later, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union, the Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts while secretly invading eastern territories of Poland in violation of the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods was until recently the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods and people across oceans.
A navy's role has traditionally been to ensure that its nationals and goods can move freely, while at the same time, preventing the enemy from doing the same to them.
A recent example of this can be seen in the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans sought to move men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean in support of the British.
At the same time, the German navy, relying heavily on U-boats, sought to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not done so, Germany might have been able to overtake Britain as the dominant power in Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them in exchange for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were often raised in herds that roamed the hills or other open country, often fed by younger or younger herders, similar to what is commonly known as herding.
The wagon was developed in England in the early 16th century.
Although the rails were made of flat wooden planks, they allowed the car to travel at a faster speed and carry larger loads over less traveled roads at that time.
Rail bearings were originally introduced to hold the track in place; however, it soon became apparent that the track could be made more efficient by adding iron over the top.
This was generally possible, but the iron made the wooden wheels of the carriage wear more quickly.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones.
The first known transport was on foot, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
The earliest humans, Australopithecus, did not necessarily walk upright all day.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more sustainably in the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become activists for reducing future problems until progress is made.
This seems to be a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we are not to think only of temporary solutions, then we must get to the root of the problem, and we must solve the problem.
It is only natural that the world has become more diverse as a result of human scientific and technological advances, and the problem is only exacerbated as populations increase and human lifestyles evolve.
Once approved by Congress on July 4, the draft was signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson and shipped several blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as the "Dunlap Leaflets".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon outside Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which was read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Papyri known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of a document; the original handwritten copies have not survived.
Most paleontologists now believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they are feathered and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
It had one leg and a hook, it swam, and it walked on two left feet like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Severe poisoning may not be immediately obvious.Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so mild that a definitive diagnosis cannot be made.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of open containers of medicines or household chemicals.
Check the label for the correct first aid instructions for the poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with ticks, which are insects highly adapted to being parasitic on humans.
Predator and prey birds are both nocturnal, adapted to live in the nests or homes of their hosts.
In the United States, there are an estimated 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.

The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method.
However, unlike experiments, experiments are tests used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and conduct research and guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers turned to classical texts and, eventually, to the Bible in Latin.
What is accepted is Aristotle's view on all matters of knowledge, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are largely dependent on endogenous cycles and their production uses the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue a period of free-running cycles in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiments were among the first to support the idea that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments labeling either DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the affinity for the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cell is a germ cell.
Some mutations in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism refers to visits to natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including wildlife, plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hiking, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning information about ecosystems.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leaving small rural towns drive to their workplaces and are passed by others whose only destination is the newly abandoned site.
In this dynamic shuttle transport everyone is involved in, and supportive of, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of the few stable environments that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries it is common to hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
How can the transportation system complain so much, how can it fail so often? Are transportation engineers underpaid? Is there something fundamentally wrong?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers operate in a reasonably consistent area; therefore, traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to represent the flow of traffic over land, relationships have been defined on the basis of three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators and obtain food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings back over their body.
This gives them a wide range with limited places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that do not shed their scales are dragonflies and dragonflies.
A thousand years earlier, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some interpretations are correct but many believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, as do the Sun (and other stars).
This makes sense, because the world doesn't seem to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the longest and second largest river on Earth, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at nearly six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the fresh water that flows from the planet's rivers to the oceans originates in the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long; it collects water from thousands of tributaries.

All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they were found in nature in their original forms and were relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although they are also thought to change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are called metals.
They also had metal alloys that contained large amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
All things are made of matter, but all matter is made of tiny atoms.
The atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
For this reason, pencils are good companions for most people when they are creating.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods were introduced, the status of the pension was reduced to a lower level.
People now type messages on computer screens, never placing them near a computer.
One can only imagine what the keyboard would do if something new was invented.
Fission bombs work on the principle that they require energy in exchange for creating a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, the nucleus rebounds and releases some of its energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they are vulnerable to little or no perturbation.
The lunar soil is rocky and dusty; the lunar mantle is called crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner below sea level and thicker below the plateau.
There may be more maria on the near side due to the thinner crust.
Content theory focuses on finding out what motivates people to act or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have internalized needs and/or desires as they grow older.
These theories examine how individuals perceive what causes them to think what they do and what factors in their environment cause them to do or not do it.
Two such content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, both behaviors can occur when managers begin to dominate their former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an outsider who feels they have to change much of what the team has done and make it their own.
However, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This often results in a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as points of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because the team can meet according to multiple time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of true "invisible teams" (Larson and La Fasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component to virtual teams.
An "invisible team" is a management team to which everyone reports.
Why do organizations always go through time-consuming processes to build learning organizations?
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional area of an organization, creativity and ingenuity are possible.
Therefore, processes for organizations working together to address what is changing can lead to new innovative processes for serving customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) defines the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance goals.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the study of cognition because they narrow the field of investigation and make them more precise.
The relationship between pathology and brain activity supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in various mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material with which to build simulation models that help us understand the processes occurring in our minds.
Although the term AI is strongly associated with science fiction, AI forms the most important branch of computer science, concerned with the intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation of machines.
Research in AI ranges from building machines to fully automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
For example, they include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as voice and facial handwriting recognition.
Such things have become discrete disciplines focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they have been built into many computer software applications and video games.
Tours are a big part of any classroom. For example, teachers would love to take their students to a place where taking the bus is not an option.
Technology allows for virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or marvel at formal art while sitting in their classrooms.
Experiencing tourism virtually is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Benner School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capitol, every year the website is renovated, but the old version is only kept online as a memo sheet.
Blogs also help to improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with good grammar and spelling, their audience generally changes.
Since regular readers were the most critical audience, bloggers began to try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Writing a blog also "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to address the audience's interests gives students an incentive to be knowledgeable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and supports students to develop distance learning beyond the traditional school day.
Using appropriate blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively reviewing Internet material, students can define their own position in the context of others' writings as well as outline perspectives on real problems (Oravec, 2002).
