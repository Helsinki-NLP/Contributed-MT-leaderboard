This has long been known. It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers but also provides an explanation for why fossils typically cannot form colors and three-dimensional patterns.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown above and yellow or carotenoid below.
This discovery explains the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur's wing lacks a precise shaft called a "rachis" but has other features of a feather, the Barnes and Barbules researchers hypothesized that the "rachis" was likely a later evolutionary advancement and that other features were also present.
The structure of the feathers suggested that they were used not so much for flight but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, this specimen shows the adult feathers of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, this specimen shows adult plumage, not that of a chick.

According to the leak, the document would mention a border dispute, which the Palestinians want based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem which is holy to both countries and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
After an agreement is signed Israel demands an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years while the PA agrees to abandon such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control trial were monitored by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., the Sporting Shooters Association will recruit qualified volunteers under the Hunting Program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters previously selected for the shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly will swear in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) tomorrow.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards fresh elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Violent protests have erupted since 2011 over the failure to hold regular elections.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods malfunctioning have been reported, including a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company did not consider serious.
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 pm GMT Friday).
Northern Mariana Emergency Management officials said there were no reports of damage anywhere in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
In the Philippine capital of Manila, a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists is hijacked and held hostage by a former Philippine policeman.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the marchers.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six people are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, children and elderly, were released early.
In Badajoz, photographers found an elderly mother in need of a toilet and killed Mondoza.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps by pursuing a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm labor pains in her spare time.
His research has shown that if a hormone is regulated it will accelerate the lung development of the fetus.
According to Xinhua, government investigators recovered the two 'black boxes' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme, our first manager. Luna died two moons ago. Such a unique, strong woman".
Dustin "Goldstein" Runnels commented that "Luna was a freak like the rest of us...maybe more so...will be loved and missed...hopefully in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the last poll, 29 per cent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple relay at the Commonwealth Games, but doubts have been cast on her fitness due to her complaints.
He was unable to take medication to relieve his pain because medication is banned from the sport.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people used various hardware and software to verify the discovery by early February, and an announcement was made on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of organic matter as well as water delivery to Earth that could have formed proteins and underpinned life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially the Earth, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He described the rumors as "political nonsense and stupidity".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately detect aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport has been installed and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of transport shortages increased the likelihood that supporters of the team would be forced to play behind closed doors.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the origin of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process takes longer due to breeding between a local Darwin finch, Geospieza fortipes, and a migrant cactus finch, Geospieza coniferostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into a small size.
It can be drawn on a thin wire, which can be twisted and plated. It can be marked or turned into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and glued onto other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "enlightenment manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color changes depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the cabbage juice is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been given up (as a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Swirl two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture in your hand will react with the outer layer, which looks strange and forms a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan city houses of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths used by men and women alike.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
In space the satellite receives a call and then returns it almost instantaneously.
Satellites are launched into space by a rocket. Scientists used telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A large rocket more than 100 feet high is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is make our transportation faster and easier.
This gave us trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Below them were more medium-sized cats that hunted everything from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that prey on small organisms such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is a trait that every cat possesses and that allows them to compete with other creatures.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consisted of one to three adult males, and a total of thirty females and cubs.
Having a large family of sisters and daughters, females usually mix more with each other.
Lion prides are largely herds of wolves or dogs that bear a striking resemblance to lions (but not other big cats), and are very deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances and pull five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars are in the genus Panthera. In the cat family, there are four types of roars.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but like a harsh, shouted phrase.
Ocelots prefer to feed on small animals such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots pursued animals and captured prey by scent, smell or when they were on the ground.
Their night vision allows them to see well in the dark and move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt by blending into their surroundings.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from its main population (such as by moving to a mountain range or river, or to a new island from which it cannot easily return) they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, they still need adaptation.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they begin to stand out from other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they cannot be called a single species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable process and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon-dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food by photosynthesis from the sun and also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the best hunter of its time, so it feared no one but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 pointed teeth, plus a set in the upper part of its mouth, which meant it could not escape anything that got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large magpies, other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
It would have attacked anything that entered the water; even giant dinosaurs such as T. rex would have been no match for it.
While much of their diet would be familiar to us, the Romans ate strange and unusual things, including wild boar, mice, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that where the poor and women preferred to eat their meals sitting on chairs, the rich preferred to eat together, where they ate in groups.
Ancient Roman cuisine may not have included foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their deities which was considered the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to form part of the temple.
The top of the minaret was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Much of the Hebrew family's life was spent in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops had open counters overlooking the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There are no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood is very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and travelling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But before its discovery, it was inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". This declaration appears on the bottom reverse of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote one, it is known that early in its life, large parchment documents (one measuring 293⁄4 inches x 241⁄2 inches) were used for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting liberated the northern part of France, but not the south.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. It was the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with them rather than fight the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in an invasion codenamed "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly larger group of people who live, work, and interact together, i.e. a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning citizen. In Latin civis means citizen, and civitas means city or state.
States are precursors to nations. A civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge across generations, a cultural footprint, and fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state officials, who were often uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
It had no power to ignore tax laws and duties between states.
The Articles required the consensus of all the states before being amended, and the states undermined the central government so much that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national football team, are the second most successful teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern Territory, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" due to its group of islands.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which initiated changes in aboriginal grain production practices and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which they ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and they ruled the island until 1945.
There are three main structures at Machu Picchu, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists an idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed and reconstruction continues today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most prevalent film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still manufactured today but features the same orientation ratio as taken by the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
This format therefore has an orientation ratio (when divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) of 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal or nearly equal to this orientation ratio.
The originally disputed and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamics by taking into account the scale of the arrangement in the image.
According to this rule the most appropriate location for the main subject is at the intersection of the line dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity bound many European states together for over a thousand years.
Its omnipotence affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the key Christian principles is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and the Church's monetary funds are specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the Church remained in Rome for more than a thousand years. So much power and wealth led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off significant military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by many international agreements of the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire part of the sea, which also posed a threat to neutral shipping.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected to respond with unrestricted submarine warfare of her own.
During the 1920s, the prevailing view of most citizens and the nation was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations expressed a desire to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each dynasty that held power was a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable era of provinces divided between each dynasty. The most famous of this period was the Three Kingdoms era that lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period there were fierce wars between the various nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands killed for occupying the highest seat in the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that a country belongs to its people, not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution the professions were opened to all male applicants which gave the most ambitious a chance to succeed.
The same process occurred for the army as army rankings were now based on merit rather than class.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave known as Hira on the mountain of Nur (Light) for meditation.
That cave has long survived, and gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Located on top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if one knows it exists. Once inside the cave, it is completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Nile Valley contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The "upper bow" mark looks like a V and the "lower bow" mark looks like a staple or a square that disappears at the bottom.
Up means you should start at the top and push the bow, down means you should start at the bottom (where your hands hold the bow) and pull the bow.
The up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while the down-bow is stronger and more vocal.
You can make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that printed bow marks are for better musical reasons, so they should usually be played accordingly.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and four year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of women in the marketplace on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, he returned to Paris. The carriage was surrounded by people who were chanting slogans against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows open.
On one occasion a man in the crowd waved the head of a royal guard executed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay a large part of the expenses and taxes to the American colonial regime to pay the interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the core profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the order.
The period during which these events took place in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD) is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the High Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or technological necessity in the strict sense to human destiny motivated by an underlying logic involving scientific laws and their expression in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has an inherent "impact" on society rather than social influence.
For example, one could say that motor cars inevitably lead to road improvements.
However, a nationwide road network just for cars is not economically viable, so new methods of production were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Large-scale car ownership led to more accidents on the roads, which led to the invention of new technologies in health care to repair damaged organs.
Libertarianism had a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography influenced people, and over time customs and cultures related to geography emerged, and these, because of their suitability to a society's location, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century the situation deteriorated, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned gifts such as silks and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of that time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture undertaken solely to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and organic system, in which seeds saved from native habitats are used to increase yields in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary by age, race, class, location/gender.
The characteristics that uniquely define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including mannerisms and tropes.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to give examples of some unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, and unfortunately or through deliberate abuse were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are referred to as "feral". Some feral children have been abandoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment was caused by the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Feral children may experience severe child abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are alleged to have domesticated animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When introduced into the midst of fully non-human animals, feral children display almost exclusively special care animal behaviors (within physical limits), such as a fear of humans or of separation from humans.
While project-based learning is meant to make teaching easier and more interesting, scaling goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but a support that provides assistance to people who are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold but the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office is.
Virtual scaffolds are implemented internally in the software and are meant to question, indicate and explain processes that may be challenging for students to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care in a variety of situations ranging from neglect to abuse and even forced recovery.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, loving, caring, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is expected to meet the needs of those lacking in the home from which they come.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
Features of the Internet take on additional dimensions in terms of perspectives of use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement"" and ""persistent relationships"" were also identified as new motivational dimensions by Egham and McCord (1998), when they examined audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recordings, minute expressions, facial movements that can be completed in a few milliseconds has led to important discoveries useful in reading.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether someone is lying or not by correctly interpreting the meaning of certain expressions.
Oliver Sacks has pointed out in his article The Presidential Speech that many people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to correctly assess sincerity.
We also suggested that its ability to explain human behavior could be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation. Variation in one group is latent and variation in the other is manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variation and selection removes expressed variation from the population.
Separation and recombination in each generation reverses the variation between the two groups.
Outside of the savanna, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to meet their amino-acid requirements from available plant resources such as trees.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences such as developmental depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources are the proteins in leaves and seeds, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they provide high amounts of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of purposefully waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
It may be easier for some to use a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you reset your clock while sleeping and then go back to sleep, you can put the clock on the other side of the room, so that you can turn it off when you get out of bed.
Other daily cycle-based alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more positive the vitality. Everyone has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is my own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but expanded from the Mahayana path of love and many of the techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga involves the awakening of kundalini energy (knowledge energy) through various postures, breathing exercises, mantras and mantras.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is Deva Yoga. Through the vision of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and knowledge consciousness is created.
Germany was a public enemy in World War II, which led to increased cooperation between the USSR and the USA. When the war ended, many countries separated due to clashes of systems, processes and cultures.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
The war lasted for the next 40 years and was fought virtually by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were already broken. The only hope left was to retreat to the Romanian bridgehead and regroup.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded Poland's eastern territories and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the "Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact", and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of watercraft is by far the most efficient way to transport goods and move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The function of a navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The most notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were attempting to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time the German navy was using mainly U-boats to try to block this route.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain because it had the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept goats for their milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds. Grazing goats roamed the hills or other grazing areas often accompanied by children or adolescents who followed the shepherd's lead. Shepherds became more widely known as herders.
Wagonways were developed in England in the early 16th century.
However wagonways were only made of parallel planks of wood to allow horses to gain more speed and pull more weight than the slightly more bumpy roads of the time.
The use of rails to hold the tracks in place began much earlier. Gradually, however, it was realized that rails would be more efficient if iron strips were placed on top of these rails.
This became commonplace but the wooden wheels of the wagons began to wear down too much due to the iron.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron railway was introduced.
The first known transport was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (i.e. upright man).
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
Bipedal specialization has been found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although as early as seven million years ago, coelenthropus could walk on two legs.
We can begin to be more environmentally friendly by joining the environmental movement and to some extent becoming activists to reduce future suffering.
This is similar to treating the symptoms of a disease in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution we should find the root of the problem and neutralize it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed greatly due to mankind's scientific and technological progress. The problems caused by overpopulation and mankind's extravagant lifestyle have increased.
After Congressmen adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary of Congress Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlop's print shop a few blocks away.
Overnight 150 to 200 copies were made of what are today known as the "Dunlop broadsides".
John Nixon read the document in public for the first time on July 8 in the yard of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
Twenty-five copies of the Dunlop broadside survive, making it the oldest extant copy of the document. However, the original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists still believe that a group of dinosaurs lived on Earth for a long time and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and adults can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet. All adults lay eggs and walk using their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on information exchange. They are encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits, to use computer terminology.
Intravenous poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are fairly common, so immediate diagnosis in such cases may not be possible.
Open containers of medication or toxic household chemicals may be the primary cause of poisoning inside the body.
Check the label for first aid instructions for specific poisonings.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Assassin-bugs and bed-bugs are both neonicotinoids, meaning they can both live in their host's nest or habitat.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system. The central nervous system consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that child custody is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may choose to plan an adoption for their child.
After adoption, the birth parents lose their parental rights so that the adoptive couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the scientific method. This method is indeed very important for most scientific research.
Although not unique, the act of experimentation and experimentation is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations are also very important to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from the Greek philosophical and scientific base.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend significantly on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not simply responses to external periodic cues have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, trees, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue the period of cyclic processes running independently even in the absence of external cues.
One of the key suggestions of the Hershey and Chase experiment was that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to transplant their own DNA into a bacterium.
We have done double experiments labeling proteins in the presence of DNA or radioactive sulfur in the presence of radioactive phosphorus.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, with the extent of genetic material affected being of considerable importance.
Mutations that occur only in cells of the genome can be passed on to offspring, while mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the natural scenery including flora, fauna and wildlife.
Activities in places with nature-based tourism include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and studying information about the ecosystem, in addition to visiting parks.
For example, travelling in Borneo means getting to know, photograph and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, as people leave the small towns in their cars to go to work, they pass by other people whose workplaces are still in the same places where the elderly have just left.
This mobility is connected to all transportation vehicles in some way and supports private car-based transportation systems.
We know from science that this massive carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its steady states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone in society participates in and uses transportation systems. However, almost everyone also complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are such complaints common in transportation systems? Why do they fail on a daily basis? Is it simply because of poor transportation engineering?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually drive within fixed limits. Therefore, the flow of traffic has some reasonable stability and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better describe traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
This relationship helps in planning, designing and operating road related facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly allows them to more easily avoid predators, obtain food and find mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back parallel to the body.
This gives them many small places to hide from predators.
Today the dragonfly is the only insect that cannot fold its wings back but can fly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the sun revolved around the solar system.
Some believe that he was correct. Others, on the contrary, believe that the solar system (including the other planets) revolves around the Earth.
This seems reasonable because it does not seem that the Earth rotates, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's second longest and largest river. It contains eight times as much water as the world's second largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's widest river. It is up to six miles wide in places.
The Amazon alone accounts for 20% of all the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
However, the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom. Despite this, the pyramids of Giza were not surpassed in their size and technical excellence of construction.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom marveled at the ancient monuments built by their ancestors over a thousand years ago.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent country and one of the most sparsely populated.
Vatican City uses the Italian language for its legislation and official communications.
The Italian language is used in everyday life by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times because they can be found naturally in nature.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything in the world was composed of a combination of one or more of the four elements. These four elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
These four states of matter were solid, liquid, gas, and plasma (in that order). However, they also theorized that they could change into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Certainly silver and gold are metals as well.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of atoms could fit into the space by the time this sentence is over.
Similarly, when the pencil was invented, it was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new forms of writing appeared, the use of the pencil declined.
People now type messages on computer screens, so they never have to go to a sharpener.
One can only imagine what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to hold many protons and neutrons together in a nucleus.
Just as it takes energy to pull a heavy car up a hill. Now some of that energy is released by re-splitting the nucleus.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, meaning that they tend to break apart with little or no force applied.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The near side of the crust is about 70 km thick and the far side 100 km thick.
It is thin below the maria and thick below the highlands.
Because of the thinning of the crust, there may have been more magma nearby. It was easier for the lava to rise above the surface.
Satisficing theory focuses on finding out what people want and what they demand from people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and wants. Needs and wants change significantly as people grow older.
These theories can provide insight into the behaviour of specific individuals, such as what they like and what they do, as well as what is in their environment that motivates them to do or not do certain things.
The two most popular satisfaction theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two types of behavior emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum are employees who want to do what they were doing before.
This makes it difficult for managers to make tough decisions, take disciplinary action, evaluate performance, assign responsibility, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, there are the self-transformers, people who feel they have to do everything the team does and adopt what is necessary for it.
The leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
These behaviors often cause a rift between the team leader and the rest of the team.
People on effective teams are held to the same good standards as people on traditional teams but there are subtle differences.
Influential team members often act as points of contact for their immediate outside group.
The members of an effective team can be located in different time zones. Therefore, effective team members usually have more authority than members of traditional teams. However, they are not given much importance by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFastow, 1989, p109) is also a unique part of effective teams.
The "invisible team" is the team of management to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can be communicated across functional departments of an organization if all available resources are used effectively.
As a result, the process of organizations working together to overcome any obstacles can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains that the continuum approach is a method used to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating cognition.
Connections between brain pathology and behavior help scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, wounds and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
With the help of new technologies it is now very easy to visualize the structure and processes of the brain. It can also be easily examined.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models.
However, AI is very important in the world of science. AI forms a very important branch of computer science.
AI research involves building machines to perform such tasks automatically, requiring intelligent behavior.
For example, it includes control, planning, and scheduling. It also includes answering customer questions and solving problems. It also includes handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Now such things have become a separate discipline that focuses on solving real-life problems.
AI systems are often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as to create many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are important for any classroom. Field trips usually take students to places where bus travel is not an option.
The technology offers solutions in the form of virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit the aquarium and admire fine art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip virtually is a good way to give feedback on the trip and share the experience with a future class.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year. However, older versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Students can improve their writing through blogs. Usually when students start their blogs, they have a lot of grammar and spelling mistakes. However, they are constantly improving with the help of audience feedback.
Students are often considered the best audience, so bloggers try to improve their writing beforehand to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to become knowledgeable about the world around them. Students also have to work hard to create blogs that are easily liked by the audience. This process of making blogs interesting encourages students to be cleverly creative (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to learn beyond traditional school days.
Proper use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical. Students can respond to Internet content and express their thoughts about others' writing. Also, they can outline their own perspectives on particular issues (Oreveke, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's beautiful and bilingual capital, is home to a range of art galleries and museums that tell the story of Canada's past and present.
In the far south of Canada is Niagara Falls. To its north is Muskoka and beyond it are homes of outstanding natural beauty.
Because of all of this and more, attractive Ontario is known to outsiders as one of the nicest places in Canada.
Further north large areas are sparsely populated. In addition, some areas are almost uninhabited forest.
This comes as a surprise to many when comparing the populations. There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands. It spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
It is recommended for women that any female traveler, regardless of actual marital status, say that she is married.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (not just the expensive ones).
Women should realize that this may be a result of cultural differences in how older people perceive harassment.
Be firm when rejected by men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't matter).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt as Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar el-Badia. It was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places selling a full range of traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and gigs, but these are all aimed at tourists.
Doma is a tourist town in the Republic of the Congo, just east of Rwanda.
Lava from the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma in 2002, burying many of the city's main streets and downtown.
Goma is very safe. Goma should be explored for exits to understand the fighting situation in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, Africa's highest mountain gorilla trail.
To get to Goma one can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). A typical fare for shorter distances is ~500 Congolese francs.
Because of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for unique and remote places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination. There is an airport.
It was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is quite different from the rest of the country because it has a more Arab than an African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It is bordered to the east by Mozambique, to the north by Zimbabwe and to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each harboring different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main tourist attractions and is considered the forerunner of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks there are daily conservation and entrance fees to visit the park.
Buying a Wild Card can be beneficial for anyone who provides admission to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the region of Hong Kong and is the location of many tourist attractions.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a magnificent bar chart illustrated by the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon Waterfront opposite.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely settled on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
It is the place that was adopted by the British colonialists and that is why if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the region, it is a good place to do so.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the mighty forests that were once found in the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is in the wetland zone.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakarta/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses going from one district to another are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts were served by small Japanese coaster buses, which were comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are an easy and comfortable means of travelling to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oiapoque River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 m high, 378 m long and have two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be finished.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who made a living by hunting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the Spanish conquistadors' wars with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Polo Field in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year there are smaller tournaments and matches.
For news of the tournament and information on buying tickets to polo matches, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is set equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island which is located in Stanley at the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the island. In addition, Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands, although British and United States currency may be accepted. Check with the owner first to determine what the acceptable payment method is.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winters are usually quite cold: temperatures do not quickly drop below zero, but the air and moisture combine to make the thermometer feel colder than it is.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, the wildlife is wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they appeared, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals could attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so let them stay in their place.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave port.
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk. About 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the War of Independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lilofi III.
Auckland has many beaches due to the spread of its two harbours. One of the three most popular areas is here.
The Northern Beaches (in the Northern Harbour District) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburb of Mission Bay, and St Heliers in central Auckland.
Sometimes there are crowded family beaches, with a variety of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Other local beers are called "manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may fare better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
The idea of a 'plain white' coffee is foreign to Australians. There is a small black 'espresso', cappuccinos come in high heels with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Numerous trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries to the reef from any cause are rare.
However, consult authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish were found north of 1770 from October to April near beaches and river mouths. They could sometimes be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, though they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are fearful of humans and will run away if threatened.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their primary habitat being the estuary of the North River from Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives passengers peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other types of accommodation such as camping grounds through your travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or a combined flight and hotel package.
They may make reservations for you if they need time to think about your offer or to obtain other documentation for your destination (such as a visa).
However, any modifications or requests must first be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most concertgoers camp at the venue and most people consider it an important part of the experience.
If you wanted to be close to one, you had to move quickly to get to a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music may have ended on the main stage, there may be parts of the celebration that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as there is quite a terrible noise for those most affected by crossing the ice.
St. Petersburg cruises include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are exempt on visa (check requirements).
Casinos typically make efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exit can be difficult.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offerings to keep guests in a good mood and on the premises.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages. However, drinking impairs judgment, and not all good gamblers know the importance of not getting drunk.
Anyone driving over high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, or icy temperatures.
An icy road has less friction and you cannot drive on it as you would on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, a large amount of snow may fall in a short period of time.
Visibility may be restricted by falling or flying snow or by condensation of snow on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs mostly non-stop throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and are a draw for many tourists.
In popular usage the term safari refers to a journey underground to view spectacular African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to the car and can be seen well with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "walking") involves hiking for either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the Games in 1964, is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation rules vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellations by the end of March do not extend beyond July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. In many hotels irons and ironing boards are available for loan, even if one is not present in the room.
If lining is not available, or if you prefer not to wear lined socks, you can use a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may shrink, or burn if overheated).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas boiling water for one minute is sufficient, others require several minutes.
Filter effectiveness varies, and if you have any concerns, you should buy your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases cause allergies, spread toxins, or spread infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill humans, are generally not considered pests.
Some places have excellent opportunities for duty-free shopping and buying goods exempt from excise duties.
Travelers visiting heavily taxed countries can sometimes save considerable money, especially on items such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is very difficult to drive, as it passes through many isolated deserted woods.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, take extra care on steep grades, narrow streets and dangerous bends.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower than the previous and following sections - typically the speed limit is 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and must be strictly adhered to.
Interestingly, mobile phone service is very good here compared to many other parts of the route such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, like their southern neighbour, Austria, are quite rich and varied.
Fruit pastries are common, apples are baked in pastries year-round, and cherries and plums are available during the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. The finest cakes are often accompanied by a cup of strong coffee, especially well mixed.
If you want something small but rich in pastries, try Berliner, Pfaffenkuchen or Kraffen regional pastries.
Curry is a dish based on meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of water.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, curd is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term encompassing a huge variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the term originally meant the cuisine of the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine consists simply of a range of seasonal dishes, the major Javanese flavors being peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrup is used to support the rider's legs, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot becoming trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but his legs get caught in the stirrups, they may be dragged as the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wore a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow, riding boot.
Subsequently, some saddles, notably English saddles, had safety straps that allowed a leather strap to fall from the saddle if the falling rider was pulled backwards.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of granite walls and crags.
The summit offers breathtaking views from the top of the mountain. Climbers from all parts of the world are constantly establishing new routes through the endless possibilities of a wall.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", and entire vacations can be planned around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC.
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually does not include alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter of which is done on steep terrain and requires very stiff skis and boots.
A skiing trail is similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will cover slightly more distance than walking - but on good roads without a heavy backpack you will have much less cross country skiing speed.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean going through many visa application and passport processing procedures.
However, the Schengen Zone operates somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you live in the area, you can generally cross the border without passing through passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each of the Schengen member countries thus saving time, money and getting rid of paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies from place to place. Age limits may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft production can be defined as antique goods despite being younger than mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami people. Commercial culture is also important for those in other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sami people are involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but most who make a living from fishing, hunting and the like keep reindeer as cash crops.
Today many Sami people work in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with misconceptions and negative stereotypes of Romani people.
Your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected if the country you are traveling to becomes subject to a travel advisory.
You can get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different circumstances than European or Arab ones.
An advisory is simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
And the ideas presented are often superficial, general and more simplified than the more detailed information available elsewhere.
