While an experimental vaccine appears to reduce Ebola mortality, to date, there is no proven cure for the existing infection.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies showed that it was less effective than intended in reducing mortality.

USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the needs of our athletes and clubs, and that of individual sports, may be better served by advancing meaningful change within our organization, rather than desertification.

This not only suggests that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widespread theory, but provides details not generally found in fossils, such as colors and three-dimensional shapes.
Scientists say the animal's fur is reddish-brown on top with a pale or reddish-yellow underside.
The discovery adds insight into the evolution of feathers in birds such as this.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had the other traits of feathers - spines and sharp claws - the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a further evolutionary development of these other traits.
The shape of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or appearance.
The researchers point out that, although this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the samples show that the dinosaur's feathers are those of a large dinosaur and not those of a chick.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effects that the team sought would be negated by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth, creating tides, so the Milky Way exerts a pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists can infer that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding galaxies is located around the galaxy in a halo, and is made of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a room, putting a piece of paper pre-printed with their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After the officer verifies the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law codifies a fairly rigid procedure.
Since 1988, the current ballot box is transparent so that voters and observers can see that there is no envelope at the beginning of the vote and no envelope is added except for votes that have been counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under the supervision of a secretary, according to a special procedure.

Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee argues that "journalists seem to be treading a dangerous path if they publish photographs etc out of the blue".
The Crown Office, which is handling the case fully, has advised reporters that no further comment will be made at least until charges are laid.
The document, according to the leak, will mention the border dispute, which the Palestinians hope will conform to the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered in the report include the future status of Jerusalem as a holy city for both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a continuous military presence in the country for ten years when the agreement was signed while the PA agreed to allow the military presence for only five years.
Shooters in additional gun control trials are closely monitored by game wardens, as the trials are monitored and their abilities evaluated.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are accepted into the Sport Shooting Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage and NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety instruction.
Martelly was sworn in by the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Four months later a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a series of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests following the violence have sometimes been overshadowed by the failure to hold elections, some scheduled since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheated iPods exploding have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor injuries.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan, stated that it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional heat events, which the company called "unusual".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's withholding of the report "extremely disappointing".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07.19 am local time (Friday at 09.19 am GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands' records management office said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer takes a Hong Kong tourist hostage by hijacking his bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six people are confirmed dead.
Six detainees, including children and the elderly, were released first, as well as a Filipino photographer.
The photographer replaced the elderly woman because she needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was then shot.
Liggins continued in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that when given hormones, fetal lung maturation was accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators managed to secure two 'black boxes' of flight recorders on Wednesday.
A fellow wrestler paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. She was my first manager. She died on the night of the two-month anniversary. She was unique in her own way. She was a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is as weird as I am...maybe more so...I love her and miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agreed with this view, hoping that Queen Elizabeth II would be Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme end of the spectrum, 29 percent of those polled believed Australia should become a republic immediately, while 31 percent believed Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but her fitness was in doubt.
He was unable to take the medication needed to manage the pain because it was banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Some people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water delivery to Earth along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to learn how the planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth in the distant past.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He described the news as "politically incorrect and inaccurate".
It appears that he intends to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and consume millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
The system uses satellite-based technology in contrast to older ground-based radar technology that allows air traffic controllers to guide aircraft with higher precision and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is operated and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and car-ride facilities are not available on land.
Concerns about lack of transportation increased the likelihood that matches would be played behind closed doors without supporters.
A study published today in the journal Science reports on the formation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in only two generations, although the process is believed to have taken much longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza konirostris.
Gold can be made into any shape. Gold can be rolled into small shapes.
Gold can be melted into thin sheets, which can be twisted and woven.
Gold can be made very thin, and adheres to other metals. Gold is made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "luminous manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical.
Carrot juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline its chemicals are.
The pH level is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions ("H" in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton whose electron has been ejected (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
The mixture of the two dry powders is combined and then, using a clean wet cloth, kneaded into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, which feels weird and forms a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected by an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of such waste disposal systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Greek civilization, toilets sometimes served as public baths where men and women gathered together.
When you call someone a thousand miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in outer space receives the call and then bounces back down, flying straight up.
Satellites are sent into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere bends some of the light with your eyes.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to place a satellite or telescope high in the sky.
Wheels have changed the world in extraordinary ways. The biggest benefit of wheels to people is that transportation is far easier and faster.
Thanks to the wheel came the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral cats) that eat far more small prey such as rodents, reptiles, lizards, and birds.
The secret to a person's success is the concept of the right niche, the specific task that each job fulfills that sets it apart from the others.
Lions are gregarious cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one or three adult males in a pride, and as many as thirty females and cubs.
His wives were often close companions, forming an extended family of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are very similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
A perfect athlete, the tiger can jump (though not skillfully), fight, jump long distances and fight five times stronger than a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of a tiger is not as loud as that of a lion, but it is more like a roaring sound.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals, catching crabs, snakes, rodents and birds when possible.
Scientists hypothesize that ocelots follow and locate prey by scent, following where the prey walks on the ground.
The ocelot hunts by attaching itself to its prey and then worshiping it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from its original main population (for example if it moves to a hillside or stream, or if it moves to a new island where it cannot relocate) it will often encounter a different environment than where it was before.
These new environments had a number of different sources of power and competition, so these new populations needed different characteristics and adaptations to be stronger competitors than what they had needed previously.
Native populations did not change one bit, they still needed the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
You call this process speciation, meaning the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and plants take in the carbon-dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
You make your houses from plants, you make your clothes from plants, you eat mostly from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except its own kind
Its long jaws decorated with 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an additional set in the roof of its mouth, meant there was no escape for those who had entered.
Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly even cannibals.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even a large dinosaur like T. rex is no match for it.
While most of the people's diet was familiar to them, the Romans did have strange or unusual foods, in the form of vegetable candies, mushrooms, chickpeas, and a type of fly called the dormouse
Another difference is that while commoners and women touch their food while sitting on a chair, wealthy men like to eat jamba together where they alternately touch and eat jamba.
The food of the ancient Romans could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not eat corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or chocolate chips, and no ancient Romans ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians built in each council a central temple that was considered to be the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open sanctuary with an inner sanctum that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shelter for the ancestors of the gods.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not really necessary.
Much of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
The women cook in the open field; the pots are spread in the streets; the stones are used for building houses.
There are no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so timber is abundant.
Greenland is sparsely inhabited. In Norse mythology it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when travelling far to the west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each country was once 'part of Scandinavia', there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence document.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence document are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although its authorship is not known with certainty, it is known at the time of its composition that this vast parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up in storage.
Thus, the note is added only as a brand.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but not the south.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way back to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture with a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis meaning civil, related to the Latin civis meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city-state, and it also describes the size of a society.
Cities are the precursors of states. The culture of a civilization indicates the inheritance of knowledge over generations, traces of culture that remain and blend naturally.
Small cultures often become extinct without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as viable civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only body - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and, in the absence of a national judiciary or executive, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to pass laws.
Congress had no authority to separate tax laws and taxes between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended and the states considered the central government so inferior that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the Northern Hemisphere, with Italians competing in international events and the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to as, geographically, as an "archipelago"
Taiwan's origin dates back to the 15th century when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a headquarters in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a shift in the production of native grains and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sorghum plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and established Taiwan as a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwanese sovereignty to Japan, which occupied the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of 3 main structures, named Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of Three Stages.
Most of the buildings around the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what the site originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common motion picture format in the world is 35mm, which became the dominant film size near the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more important is the aspect ratio inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm size is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the whole-number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family formats, for example) are equal to or roughly close to this aspect ratio.
The often-misused and overlooked rule of thirds is a simple rule of thumb that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that separate the image into its vertical and horizontal halves (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had bound the countries of Europe together despite many differences in language and culture.
Its all-encompassing power affected both royalty and commoners.
One of the many principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and church endowments exist for that reason.
The central power of the church was held by Rome for over a thousand years and the centralization of power and money has led many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted International law, codified by several international treaties.
The British mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering all parts of the ocean, posing a danger to neutral shipping.
Because there was a limited response to this tactic, the Germans preferred a similar response to their unrestricted battleships.
During the 1920s, the prevailing mood of the majority of the population and citizens was one of unrest and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a repeat in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each Chino stage or ruling dynasty was a distinct dynasty.
The most notable of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this period fierce fighting took place between various nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest seat in the imperial court at Xi'an.
Many social and political impacts such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that language belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
And after the Revolution jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing only the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military as instead of ranking based on class, the person is now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life. He often visited the cave known as 'Hira' on Mount 'Nur' (light) for shelter.
Muhammad's solitude in the cave, which persisted over time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual maturity.
Resting on the summit of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
It's not even easy to find one, even if people know it exists. That's being in a cave, that's total isolation.
Nothing could be seen but the clear blue sky above and the many mountains around. Few sights could be seen or sounds could be heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
Large pyramids were built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The "upper eyebrow" mark appears V-shaped and the "lower eyebrow" mark looks like a stump or square that has lost its bottom line.
Upper means you should start at the tip and eat the mushroom, and lower means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand is holding the mushroom) and eat the mushroom.
The upper lips generally produce a softer sound, while the lower lips are harder and higher pitched.
Please feel free to mark yourself with a pencil, but remember that there is a musical reason for the markings, so they should always be followed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Theresa aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were on 6 October 1789 ordered back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
On the train, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd who shouted threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd demanded that the King and Queen open their windows wide.
At one point a member of the mob held up the head of the Royal Guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The cost of the US colonial war in subjugating the Philippines was borne by the Filipino people themselves.
The people were ordered to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to finance most of the issuance and interest of floating bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous benefits derived from this wholehearted action towards the Filipino people continued to be the main benefits of U.S. colonization.
In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that led to their formation.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention lasted about 1500 years.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, ranging from technological drive or technological necessity to an explicit understanding of human agency driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: that the language of technological development follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that the language of technology in turn has an 'influence' on society that is not discrete, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you might argue that the advent of the automobile led to the development of highways.
However, the national road network was not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership could lead to greater injuries on the roads, leading to the invention of new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a major cultural influence, derived from the writings of Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures associated with geography emerged, and these, along with the location of the society, were preferable to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the center of fashion today, so Constantinople is known as the center of fashion in early modern Europe.
It was well known as a centre of luxury beginning around 400 AD and lasting until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined from the twelfth century onwards due to the fact that the Crusaders brought back gifts of silk and spices far more valuable than those available on the Byzantine market.
It was during this time that the style's centre of gravity shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow pace of communication, trends in the west can last 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages western Europe began to develop its own styles.
Subsistence farming is farming practised to produce enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and typically organic system that uses native seeds stored in an ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other more sustainable means to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, which still exists today in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel alienated from societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be differentiated based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that distinguish one subculture from another may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of all of these.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership through the use of symbolic and distinctive styles, which include fashion, behavior, and profanity.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of motherhood is to depict several cases of unfortunate children who suffered neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, ignored by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "illegitimate" or uncultured. Some illegitimate children have been rejected by society (usually by their own parents); in some cases the rejection is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual and physical disabilities.
Other children may experience severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are thought to have been eaten by animals; some are said to have lived in solitary confinement.
When fully aroused by an animal other than a human, the cub displays behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely consistent with that of its caregiver, including fear and indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support for each person who experiences a new learning experience for example using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and tangible, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold but so is the little man with the paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in software and are used to question, encourage, and explain stages that may be challenging for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in Orphanages for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to abuse.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment without love, care and nurturing, but it happens.
We see the Orphanage System as a safe place for these children.
The orphanage system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving care, stable education, and reliable health care.
An orphanage is supposed to provide for the needs of children whose previous homes were inadequate.
The Internet combines two elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinguishing characteristics of the internet have led to the formation of additional dimensions in the approach to consumption and gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" were also introduced as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has made important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial expressions that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can tell if they are lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks in the newsletter The President's Speech, demonstrated how people who are unable to understand speech due to left brain damage can understand and judge sincerity correctly.
He even suggested that the ability to fashion such a sense of human nature could be present in animals such as the local dog.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Separation and recombination shake variation back and forth between the two populations with each generation.
In the wild, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to obtain amino acids from available plant sources.
Unfortunately, failure to do so has serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most abundant and readily available plant sources of energy are the proteins found in leaves and nuts, but these ingredients are difficult for primates to digest unless cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (seeds, grains, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they provide a high protein content containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, you should not be surprised if your ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
A sleep disorder is the process of voluntarily waking up during a person ' s normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using an alarm clock that is loud enough to bring the patient to consciousness without actually keeping the patient awake.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be reversed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which are known diuretics) before going to bed, forcing the person to get up to go to the toilet.
The amount of peace a person has is directly proportional to the amount of stress in that person's body and mind.
The less stress, the better the vitality. Everyone has the possibility of finding lasting peace and tranquility.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to achieving this goal is self - pressure and self - denial.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but is influenced by the Mahayana love path and by many Indian Yoga techniques.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the all-embracing path of love.
With Kundalini Yoga, this Kundalini energy (energy of initiation) is awakened through yoga positions, chanting exercises, spells, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the contemplation of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are enlivened and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to close cooperation between the USSR and the USA.
With two years from the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
The Cold War continued for the next 40 years and was fought with virtual proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and regroup along Romanian lines.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to move these vast distances was the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Naval operations have traditionally ensured that a host nation maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, dealing with the ability to withdraw its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II.
At the same time, the German navy, mostly using U-boats, secured the passage.
Had the Allied forces been defeated, Germany might have occupied Britain like other European countries.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
Subsequent cultures and tribes began to breed goats to facilitate obtaining milk, wool, meat, and skins.
Domesticated sheep were usually kept in free-ranging herds on hills or other grassy areas, often tended by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the common herding methods still used today.
The solid was made in England in the early 16th century.
Although the track was only made of straight timber, people could use horses to pull it so that it could run faster and carry more weight than those on the rougher roads.
The crossing knot was originally used to hold the track in place, but it was eventually realized that the track would be more effective if it were supported by iron supports.
This became the general rule, but the rust made solid wood wheels wear out more quickly.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones.
The first known transport was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Originally, Australopithecus was not used to walking upright.
Bipedal species are found in the Australopithecus trunk from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
You can start to live green, you can join the environmental movement, you can even become a participant in reducing future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to the handling behavior in many situations. However, if you don't just want a temporary solution, then you have to figure out the root of the problem, and you have to fix the problem.
It is obvious that the world is changing due to the development of human science and technology, and the problems are becoming greater because of the overpopulation and because of the excessive human lifestyle.
After the letter was received by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressional President John Hancock and clerk Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the "Dunlap cross".
The letter was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon on the grounds of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of the letters was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
Twenty-five Dunlap crosses have been identified as the earliest surviving copies of the letter; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Many people do not think that birds are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about these birds still look the same as dinosaurs.
It had clawed feet, was naked, and walked on its hind legs like a T-Rex.
In fact almost all computers in use today rely on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values: 0 or 1, in which case they are referred to as binary digits - or bits, a computer term.
The toxicity that occurs in the body may not be directly visible.Symptoms, such as vomiting are common enough that a direct diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indicator of toxicity in the body may be the presence of drug or chemical deposits in an open house.
Check the available guidelines for first aid for specific poisons.
The term hamo is used by hamo experts themselves in a formal sense for this group of hamo.
The term derives from the ancient familiarity of the cassowary, which is an adaptable host that parasitizes humans.
Both Assassin lice and caseous lice are mutually nidicolous, adapting to live in nests or mate with their hosts.
Throughout the United States, there are an estimated 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disorder in children and young adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Research suggests that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
The couple may decide that having a baby is not in their best interests, or the best interests of their child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adopting a child, the parent then waives his or her parental rights so that another partner can have custody of the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which guides most scientific research.
An experiment is a test that is used to reduce one or more possible outcomes, answer a question, and conduct a review in order to guide scientific research.
Herpetologists and philosophers relied on the classical writings and, in particular, on the Gospels in Latin.
It accepted Aristotle's views on all matters of knowledge, including the soul.
As knowledge of Greece declined, the West found itself cut off from Greek philosophy and science.
Many rhythms of interest in physiology and behavior actually depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production throughout the biological clock.
Circadian rhythms, which are not simply responses to external cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological time is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to circulate freely even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiments were among the first to suggest that DNA was the material associated with heredity.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or spores, to grow their DNA into a bacterium.
The two conducted two experiments identifying either DNA in phages with radioactive phosphorus or phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the material involved in the affected offspring, and whether the affected cell is a germ cell.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can result in cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism involves the public's interest in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visiting gardens and learning about the environment.
Examples are visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns by car to go to work and pass people whose job purpose is the place they just left.
In this reciprocal transport, anyone can be pressured into joining, and supporting, a private car-based transport system.
Modern natural sciences suggest that this large carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that had supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Most people are familiar with the transportation system.
In developed countries one rarely hears such complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such failures, why do they fail on a daily basis?
Traffic Lines is the study of lines connecting drivers and vehicles between two points and the connections they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying surface currents is difficult because of the unpredictable behavior of the driver.
For him, conductors often behave within a sufficiently fixed range; thus, plane currents have a well-defined regularity and can be mathematically represented repeatedly.
To better represent the frequency of surface motions, relationships have been made between three main characteristic properties: (1) motions, (2) density, and (3) stiffness.
These associations assist in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Saranggo was the first animal to fly into the air. Its ability to fly helped it to evade predators more easily, and to be more aggressive in searching for food and mates.
Most nests have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
Thus there is a greater choice of small places for them to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people think they are correct but many believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
It seems reasonable, since the Earth is not a perfect sphere, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide.
Twenty percent of all fresh water flowing from the planet's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller streams.
Although the construction of the pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the size and sophistication of the Giza pyramids.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt celebrated historic buildings created by its predecessors, which were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800, making it the world's smallest independent state and the most sparsely populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and as an official language.
Italian was also the everyday language spoken by most people working in the city while Latin was often used in religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the first chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they all occur in nature in a natural form and are relatively cheap to extract using non-modern tools.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle said that all matter is composed of one or more of the four classical elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, vapor, and plasma, although it also says that matter can change into new substances to form what you see.
Mixed metals are actually a mixture of two or more metals.
The common elements calcium and potassium are considered metals, but there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain fewer non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
It is so small that a trillion atoms could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when they first started out.
Unfortunately, when new writing systems appeared, the pencil was relegated to second place.
People now type messages on computer screens, never touching the keys.
You can only imagine what this keyboard would look like if something newer came along.
Atomic bombs work on the principle that it takes energy to fuse together an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting an atom's nucleus means releasing some of its energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus which means they tend to break apart with little or no collision.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and ash.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner below sea level and thicker below the highlands.
It is likely that there are more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner and it is easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on discovering what attracts people to content.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become more acute as they grow into adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do and what it is about their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Thing Theory.
Generally speaking, there are two behaviors that can arise when an employer begins to lead a group of peers: at one end of the continuum is an attempt to remain "part of the boys' group" (or girls' group).
These bosses have difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities, and keeping people accountable.
At the other extreme, the owner transforms into an unknown person who feels the need to change what the team has created and make it his own.
Usually, the owner is directly responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in resentment between the employer and the entire team.
Virtual teams are bound by the same rules as conventional teams, but with a few differences.
Members of a virtual team often serve as points of contact for their physical group.
They often have more freedom in self-organization than conventional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a special component of a virtual team.
This "invisible team" is the management team to which each team member reports.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization?
When strongly held beliefs are applied across all functional parts of a group, creative thinking and creative thinking can occur.
As a result, the way an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new way of working invented to serve customer needs.
Before an organization becomes capable of innovation, leaders need to create a culture of innovation as well as knowledge sharing and group learning.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum method as a method used to help a group achieve a higher level of job performance.
Neuroscientists have provided compelling evidence for a research-based approach to the investigation of consciousness, making the area of inquiry narrower and more precise.
The relationship between the science of brain disease and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain diseases, traumas, injuries, and tumors influence behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies has allowed us to see and examine the structure and function of the brain as never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create training examples that help us understand how our brain works.
Although AI is often associated with the science fiction genre, it has become a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligence adjustment of a machine.
Research on AI includes enabling machines to automate tasks that require skillful behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to handle customer inquiries and requests, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial expressions.
That form has become a separate field, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they have been incorporated into some home computers and video game software packages.
Field trips are a big part of every class. Teachers usually like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers an outlet for virtual field trips where students can view artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire works of art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing stories about field trips in an informal way can also be a great way to commemorate a particular trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol, every year the website is redesigned, but the old form is still stored online as a clipping.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of readers often changes that.
Since readers are usually careful readers, bloggers began to try to improve their writing to avoid bad reviews.
Blogging also "encourages students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to satisfy readers' interests inspires students to be more creative and engaged (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, and encourages students to learn beyond what is taught in regular classrooms.
Appropriate use of blogs "can allow students to become more comfortable with drawing conclusions and to think more deeply; by diligently accessing material on the internet, students can explain their position in relation to other people's writing, and express their point of view on certain issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is an exciting, bilingual part of Canada and offers a variety of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Far to the south are Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and its surroundings.
All of this and more highlighted Ontario as the Canada it truly is to outsiders.
Large areas to the north are sparsely populated and partly forested.
A surprising population comparison: More African Americans live in the U.S. than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and is a continent in its own right in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent nations, or allied to France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to those countries, spreading as far as the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region borders the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is common for every female traveler to say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It is even more beautiful if you wear a ring (as it does not look very expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they may perceive as harassment and that it is not uncommon for women to be followed, groped, or otherwise harassed.
Be firm in rejecting men, do not be afraid to defend your position (different culture or not, does not make it permissible!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, later renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is the most expensive place to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajine, pottery, leather goods, hookah cigarettes, and a range of small items, but these are mostly for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the easternmost region near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered almost all the streets of the city, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma should be investigated in order to understand the situation in the still volatile North Kivu province.
It is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (jeepney). The normal (local) cost is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short distance.
Combined with the difficulty of the place to visit, "Timbuktu" became a metaphor for a strange and remote place.
Today, Timbuktu is a bustling city, although its name makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
The city was a key location during Henry Louis Gates' Special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city is very different from other cities in the country, because it has more Arab talent than African talent.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different natural regions, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa 's major designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) and is regarded as the pinnacle of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there is a day-use fee and an entrance fee.
It may also be useful for people who purchase a Wild Card, which provides admission to the parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the territory of Hong Kong, which is a major tourist attraction.
The cluster of high-rise buildings gives Hong Kong's skyline the appearance of a shimmering bar reflecting the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, it is best to leave the island and go to Kowloon beach on the other side of the island.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the land mass that forms the sea along the northern coast.
This is where the British took possession and if you want to look for evidence of colonization there, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the most extensive coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coasts of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they are among the last remnants of the great forests that once covered the land on both sides of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is wetland.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans has been a protected wildlife sanctuary, with an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 leopards living in the area.
Buses depart from car parks between sections (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and Jakar / Bumthang depart between 06.30 and 07.30.
Since buses between these districts are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets several days in advance.
Most of that section uses the small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and powerful.
Riding a shared taxi is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long and have two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge is not due to open to pedestrian traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully completed in September 2017, when the Barazil maintenance site is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are the most diverse indigenous people currently living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as traditional hunter-gatherers who also farm to support their families.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long and have two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, then called the "Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of contact between Spanish explorers and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began their colonization which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve its indigenous identity.
Argentina is often cited as having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest event of the year takes place in December on the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Group matches and smaller matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For information on the event and where to buy tickets, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is fixed at one British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West shopping centre.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere in the islands and can be in the form of Stanley credit cards and the American dollar is often accepted.
In the islands where credit cards are not accepted, although British and American money is acceptable; it is advisable to ask the seller first how to pay.
It is almost impossible to open a Falklands account once you have left the island, so it is advisable to exchange money before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, when it is summer there in the Northern Hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo enjoys moderate temperatures; in the summer, temperatures usually exceed +30 °C (86 °F).
Winters can be very cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and cold temperatures can make it colder than indicated on an air gauge.
There are no specific "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though many animals have frequent encounters with humans, wild animals remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park rules, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and hyenas and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife!
Regardless of how friendly the animal appears, American badgers, moose, elk, bears and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year tens of thousands of visitors are killed because they do not keep their distance. These animals are large, wild, and will be able to withstand injury, so it is better to feed the beast.
In addition, it is important to remember that strong smells can attract bears and other animals, so it is advisable to bring or offer strong smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The country is located on Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval skirmish in 1889 when seven navies from Germany, America and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one of the surviving British ships were sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the Tamasese chief Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches that are safe for swimming and most have pohutukawa trees for shelter.
The beaches on Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded and there are reefs along the coast.
The local water is called 'Number One', which is not very sweet, but rather warm and fresh. The other water is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more palatable.
Tap water is also available for drinking, but if you are afraid to drink bottled water, it is prohibited.
For Australians, the term "flat white" is somewhat unusual: black coffee is used for espresso, cappuccino is served with plenty of cream (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is widely sold in Belgium.
Many reef viewing trips are held each year, and many reef-related accidents occur during these trips.
By all means, follow the direction of those in charge, obey the instructions, and heed any lifesaving warnings.
Box jellyfish have been found living near the coast and near estuaries from October to April since 1770, and often on other days.
The sea turtles are distant, but they rarely attack humans. In fact, they are often scared and run away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not normally live in the sea, but rather in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking before setting out on a trip gives visitors peace of mind because they already have a place to stay when they arrive.
Travel agents may already work with certain accommodations, although you can book other accommodations, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer breakfast packages, transportation to/from the airport and flight and accommodation packages.
They can also give the employer time to think or take time to prepare documents (such as visas).
Any changes or reservations must be notified to the agent in advance and cannot be made directly to the accommodation.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to camp on-site, and most officials consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should come early to get a camping location close to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music on the main stage may have ended, there may be a section of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.

Anyone who will be driving at altitude or hiking in the mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or cold temperatures.
On wet or snowy roads, friction is usually low and drivers are uncomfortable driving on asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to cover the ground can fall in a short period of time.
Visibility may be limited by falling or blowing snow or by ice buildup on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, slippery and snowy road conditions are quite normal in many countries, and the terrain is not affected by snowfall throughout the year.
Sapphire is probably the greatest attraction in Africa and a major draw for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used to refer to long journeys undertaken by virgins to see African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, frequent vehicles and objects that would be easy to see with the naked eye.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them more clearly with binoculars.
Hiking (also called "walking bush", "climbing bush", or "walking foot") involves climbing, either for several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you book your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the delay is announced, you may face a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but in late March almost all coronavirus cancellations were not extended until July 2020, when the Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical ticket prices costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed, even if they are not in the room.
If a drawstring is not available, or if you do not like wearing socks that have been pulled up, you can try using a hair straightener, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the cloth (it may cause breastfeeding, or in an emergency, scald).
There are different ways to treat water, some effective for specific threats.
In certain areas boiling water for a few minutes is sufficient, in other places it may take several minutes more.
The effectiveness of filtration varies, and employers should be cautious, so employers should consider buying water in sealed packaging from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animals that are very different from those in your home country.
Amounts can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse trigger an allergic reaction, cause nausea, or prolong an infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or predators that can harm or kill humans by biting, are usually excluded as hosts.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties at specific locations.
Tourists bound for countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont provides some of the most congested driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often crossing rural roads without traffic.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, you are always welcome: steep climbs, narrow roads, sharp turns predominate.
The allowed vehicle speed limit appears to be significantly lower than the next and previous sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to it is even more important than vice versa.
Surprisingly, cell phone service is stronger here than many others along this road, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very rich, and in Bavaria, very rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbour, Austria.
Dried fruit cakes are common, with apples baked into cakes throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing throughout the summer.
Many German baking ingredients also incorporate almonds, hazelnuts, and other nutty plants.
If you want a rich but small pastry, try a layer cake called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared by cooking, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on how much water it contains.
In its native regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is generally used in curry dishes; in South India and around the coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualifier, the term condoang means that the food is originally from the central or eastern part of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a rich array of spicy dishes, including nuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese cloves) and a variety of fragrant spices.
Sanggurdi are supports for the rider's legs that rest on either side of the board.
They provide good stability for the rider but can be a safety issue due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting caught in them.
If the rider is separated from the horse but his feet are caught in the saddle, he may be dragged if the horse runs. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with soft, narrow heels and soles.
In addition, some paddles, especially British paddles, have a safety bar that allows the leather strap to fall off the paddle if tilted backward by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large walls and granite outcrops.
The summit offers a breathtaking view from the top of the mountain. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes among the endless possibilities.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending a snow-covered area on skis or skis attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major outdoor activity with many enthusiasts, commonly referred to as "ski bums", who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: Also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually not to be confused with ski touring or alpine style mountaineering, the latter of which is performed in steep terrain and requires heavier ski boots and equipment.
Think of the ice skating route as a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat more distance than walking - but only very rarely will you be able to ski cross-country without a heavy backpack on a paved route.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to pass visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen zone will, however, function somewhat like a single country in this respect.
During your stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without passing through passport control.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each Schengen member state separately, thus saving time, money and administration.
There is no universal understanding of the antiquity of mass-produced items; some tax agencies argue that items more than 100 years old qualify as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the shelf life of goods may be shorter in North America than in Europe.
Handmade items may be considered antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income among the Sámi and is a cultural activity as well as a means of livelihood.
Traditionally, though, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, living from trading, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer mostly as pets.
Today, many Sámi also work in modern fishing. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi homeland.
Despite its widespread use, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is generally considered impolite because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is the subject of a travel company recommendation, your health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may wish to negotiate advice from governments other than your own, but your advice is made for your people.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may experience events differently from Europeans or from Arabs.
A recommendation is simply a brief summary of the political situation in a particular country.
The views expressed are typically brief, general and very simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for hazardous weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious disruption in society, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and takes several forms, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and consequences of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes and typhoons.
Domestic and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, ice storms, and ash storms.
