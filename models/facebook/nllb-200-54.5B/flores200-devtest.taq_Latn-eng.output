This provides evidence that dinosaurs had jaws, a popular theory, but also provides evidence that they could not walk upright, such as teeth and third molars.
Scientists speculate that the impact event may have been caused by a chestnut-colored object above or below the asteroid.
The discovery provided insight into the life of the ancient Egyptians.
Because dinosaur skulls did not have a highly elongated bone called a rachis, but instead had other features of skulls - barbs and barbules - the researchers attributed the rachis to a combination of these features.
The shape of the teeth suggests not so much an up-and-down, but rather an up-and-down arrangement of segments.The researchers say that while they like to think this is a dinosaur footprint, its appearance suggests that humans walked on land before the dinosaurs.
Researchers have suggested that although this is a juvenile dinosaur footprint, its body shows signs of having been handled by someone other than a child.
