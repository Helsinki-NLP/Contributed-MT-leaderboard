Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a popular de facto theory, but it also provides details that fossils in general cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown above and pale or carotenoid below.
The discovery provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a long tail called the vertebral column but other characteristics in these feathers, such as protrusions and spines, researchers have found that the vertebral column was most likely a byproduct of later evolution of these other characteristics.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers say that although the dinosaur's tail is small the specimen shows that the feathers are large, not small.
The researchers said that although this was a small dinosaur tail, the specimen showed adult bird feathers and not chicken feathers.

The resulting work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Milky Way.
The effect that the team investigated was caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way attract the Milky Way.
Scientists have been able to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory predicts that most of the dark matter around a galaxy remains in its halo-like envelope, consisting of small particles in huge numbers.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech affair: voters would isolate themselves in a booth, and place a pre-printed piece of paper with their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After officials check the voter's card, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and proceeds to the voting list.
The French electoral law regulates the procedure in a very strict and precise manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can ensure that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting, and that only envelopes belonging to registered and duly authorized voters are washed.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each part of the process. At night, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and following certain procedures.

Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is held in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may have been fabricated due to her image being widely published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts have considered that the publication of photographs may constitute prejudice.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said that it ""seems to me that journalists are taking a dangerous approach if they publish photos or anything similar of suspects".""
The Crown Office with overall responsibility for prosecutions told reporters that it would not comment further, at least until charges are laid.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, an issue of importance to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel requires a continued military presence in the valley for ten years, pending an agreement, but the Palestinian Authority agrees that such a presence will last only five years.
The guards had to strictly supervise the shooters in a supplemental pest control experiment, and the experiment was run and evaluated for effectiveness.
A partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia has identified qualified volunteers for the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy director of parks and heritage protection at the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunt received extensive training in safety guidelines and training.
Martelli yesterday swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council.
This is Martelli's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to organize new elections in the country.
The Committee served as Martelly's response to the massive anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure of elections scheduled for 2011.
Approximately 60 iPod malfunctions and overheating were reported, causing at least six fires and injuring four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it was aware of 27 hardware-related incidents.
Last week, MITI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating that the company described as "non-serious".
The department responded to Apple's call to delay the report as "really unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (Friday 09:19 pm GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reported no damage in the country.
One person who worked at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there were no indications that a tsunami could occur.
A policeman who worked for the government dared to take tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several passengers have been rescued and at least six have died so far.
Six hostages were freed immediately, including children and elderly people as well as two Filipino photographers.
The photographers then impersonated an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom, and then shot Mendoza.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and medicine became his profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and worked at Auckland National State Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began investigating preterm birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
His research showed that taking the hormone could cause the fetus' lungs to grow faster.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders or so-called black boxes on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers praised Luna coldly.
"Luna was my first extreme queen. My first manager, Luna, died on the night of the two moons", said Tommy Dreamer. "She was a strong woman, unmatched".
Dustin "Goldstein"" Runnels said, "Luna was as strange as I was...and perhaps more so than I was...I love her and miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia being a republic increased by eight percentage points from 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of respondents agreed with this view, and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
In the most recent poll we have 29 per cent thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 per cent thought Australia should not become a full republic.
The Olympic gold medallist's physical fitness was called into question by his complaint, as he was scheduled to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games.
He cannot take the medication he needs to overcome his pain because it is forbidden in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, successfully discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several people using different hardware and software beginning in February and announced on Tuesday.
Comets are thought to be a source of Earth's water supply, as well as organic matter that could form proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed from a long-ago comet impact.
Cuomo, 53, began his term earlier this year and signed a bill last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political and ridiculous drivel".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
It is a next-generation system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses a satellite-linked system as opposed to the older ground-based radar system to help air traffic controllers locate aircraft with very high accuracy and provide pilots with very specific information.
There will be no additional transport, local public transport trains will not stop at Wembley, and there will be no car parking, garden facilities or stadium transport facilities.
Concerns about transportation shortages led to the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors without spectators.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports that a new species of bird has appeared in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the evolution of new species continued for only two generations although the process seemed to take a very long time due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium-sized ground finch, the migratory cactus finch, and the one-billed ground finch.
Gold can be manufactured in all possible shapes. It can be damaged into smaller forms.
It can be pulled in a thin wire that can be twisted and untwisted, and it can also be tapped or rolled into sheets.
It could be made thinner or glued onto another metal. It could be so thin that it was used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of the chemical. An indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice varies depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical to be tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been stripped (this is because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Turn the dry powder slightly and squeeze it into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving your hands a strange feeling and forming a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every home connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sanitation systems have been found in Minoan houses in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths because men and women bathed together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives and reflects the call almost instantaneously.
The satellite into space was tracked by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way, but providing easier and faster transportation is the most important thing it has done for us.
We took trains, buses and many other forms of transportation.
Among them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally there are small cats (including domestic feral cats) that eat more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The reason for their success was the concept of status, a special function for each cat that prevented them from competing with others.
Lions are highly social cats and can live in large groups called prides.
The lion family contains one to three adult males, as well as thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually close-knit because they form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Herds of lions behave like packs of wolves or dogs, which are very similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
An excellent athlete, the leopard can climb (though not very well) and can swim and glide long distances as well as pull five times as hard as a human.
The tiger is placed in the same group (genus Tigris) as lions, jaguars, and jaguars. The four species are the only ones that can make a roaring sound.
A tiger's roar is not the same as a lion's full-throated roar, but is more like a shout of angry words.
The pygmy leopard prefers to eat small animals, and will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if given the opportunity. Almost all animals preyed upon by the pygmy leopard are smaller in size.
Scientists have found that feral cats track and find prey using their sense of smell; they also sniff out their location on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and they move stealthily as well. Panthers also hunt their prey by aligning with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a few populations) become separated from the main group from which they originated (e.g., when they migrate across a mountain range or a river, when they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
Because this new environment contains different resources and competitors, this newly emerging group will require different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor if it is to function than the force that it previously required.
Aboriginal peoples never underwent any change, they still needed the same methods of adaptation as we know them.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they gradually become less similar to other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will be so different that we will no longer call them the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide that they exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis and also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, no animals could survive.
Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of its time so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were anchored by more than 70 razor-like teeth and another set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing could get in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other dinosaurs, and it may have been carnivorous.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was unable to stop it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual elements of the holiday, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the vole.
Another difference was that the poor and the middle class ate their meals sitting on chairs, while the rich preferred to set their tables upright and recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman diets could not have included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or even cocoa and the ancient Romans did not eat turkey.
For each of the gods, the Babylonians built a major temple that was considered the home of the deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs during festivals and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard surrounded by a secure enclosure to which only priests could enter.
Distinctive pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe place for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home is of little importance.
Much of a Hebrew family's life was outdoors.
Stoves were cooked in the courtyard; shops were merely open balconies overlooking the street. Stone was used in the construction of houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was expensive.
Greenland has been inhabited sporadically. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found and named Greenland.
Prior to its discovery these areas were inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you may have noticed that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. There is something written on the back of the paper but it's not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence is inscribed on the reverse with the words "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document upside down.
Although the author of this portion of the text is unknown, we do know that the large manuscript (293⁄4 in × 241⁄2 in) was stored folded early in its existence.
Therefore, the symbol may be an addition rather than a pure designation.
The landings of D-Day and subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was under French "Vichy" rule. These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion codenamed "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France, and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people living and working together, a community.
The root of the word civilization is the Latin word civilis, meaning citizen, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and is also loosely defined as the community of people.
The city-state is the first step in nation-building. Civilizational culture is essentially the intergenerational transmission of knowledge and a favored and equitably distributed cultural imprint.
Microcultures often disappear without any actual historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
At the time of the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies initially formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only component with the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, was dependent on the often uncooperative state governments to enforce all its laws.
It also had no overriding authority over interstate taxation and customs laws.
The Articles required that they be agreed to by all the states before they could be amended and the states resented the central government so much that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team and the Germany national football team are two of the most successful national teams in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, sledge hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's archipelago, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan began as far back as the 15th century when European sailors wrote that the island was called lha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a base in southwestern Taiwan and began changing native grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings, the Antihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues today.
For example, the most commonly used format for still photography in the world is 35 mm, the most common film format at the end of the analog film era.
Production still continues to this day, but more importantly the format incorporated image sensors into digital cameras and inherited their higher aspect ratio.
The 35 mm model is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this image is (but divide by 12 to get the smallest integer ratio) so it will be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the Advanced Picture System format family) equal or approximate this aspect ratio.
Misused and often ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guiding principle that serves to create dynamism while maintaining some order in a graphic image.
The most striking location of the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three dimly and horizontally (see illustration).
The Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was under the scrutiny of the Inquisition during this period of European history.
Christianity has bound European countries together for over a thousand years despite their differences in language and customs.
The all-encompassing power he possessed had an impact on everyone from the king to the common people.
A central Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church coffers exist for precisely this reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money left many people wondering if this doctrine had served its purpose.
Britain moved quickly to blockade Germany by sea after skirmishes and skirmishes broke out.
The strategy proved effective; vital military and civilian supplies were cut off, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law that had been written and harmonized in some international conventions over the previous two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of ocean, threatening even neutral shipping.
Having little response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, peace and isolationism were the preferred stance of most citizens and nations.
After seeing the horrors that World War I had brought, the country wanted to avoid it happening again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to America with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of referring to specific periods in history; they referred to all periods of China or each dynasty in power was of a different type.
There was also a period of instability with provinces being divided between each dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which spanned 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods there was intense warfare between many nobles who wanted to reach the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest seats in the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
The social and political implications are numerous, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the state belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also after the revolution, jobs paid compliments to the young doctors and this was an opportunity for those with a more infectious dream.
The same was true in the army because instead of army ranks being based on class, they were now based on rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had a strong interest in the things that transcend this worldly life. He used to go to a cave called the Cave of Hira above the Mountain of Light to meditate.
The prophet's godlessness which has persisted throughout the ages presents itself as a very vivid picture of Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on a mountaintop to the north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not always easy to find even if you know it is there. Once inside the cave, it is completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen except the beautiful clear sky over the many surrounding mountains. Little or nothing can be seen or heard of the interior except the atmosphere of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence.
The Great Pyramid built by the pharaohs in the 3rd century BC is a large pyramidal structure built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "funerary city of Giza" located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has some pyramids (most notably the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and a Sphinx.
The largest pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
A "turn up" sign looks like a V and a "turn down" sign looks like a staple or a square with no bottom.
An upper mark indicates that we should start at the tip and push the bow, while a lower mark means that we should start at the end of the bow (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and slightly louder.
Don't hesitate to draw your markings in pencil, but I think curved printed markings are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
Horrified, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women on October 15, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage and were surrounded by a crowd who were shouting and cheering against the king and queen.
A mob succeeded in forcing the king and queen to open their carriage windows at last.
One of the gang at one point beheads one of the royal guards killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
It was the Filipino people themselves who drove American imperialism to war in its invasion of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to defray a large portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, it was the enormous profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people that would constitute the principal gains of U.S. imperialism.
We need to understand the context that led to the organization's creation, to accommodate the Templars.
The era in which all of these events occurred was the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, all of which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide variety of ideas, ranging from technological dynamism or technological necessity to the strictly humanistic view that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic involving scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path significantly removed from cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has an inherent and socially unconditioned "influence" on society's culture.
For example, one could say that the automobile engine led to the development of bridges.
Establishing a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a few vehicles, so new routes are being developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Mass car ownership has also led to an increase in road accidents, and has led to the development of new methods in health care to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism was based on a large element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
As the Romantic movement progressed, geography was shaped by individuals, and over time the customs and culture associated with that geography persisted, and these, being at peace with the place of the community, were preferable to coercively imposed rules.
Paris is now known as the fashion capital of the world, but Constantinople was the fashion capital of Europe during feudalism.
Its fame as a centre of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its situation deteriorated during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices which had a higher value than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
By this time, however, Paris had replaced Constantinople as the fashion capital.
The Gothic style reached its zenith in the 10th or 11th to 14th centuries.
The ruins were initially influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, conditions in the West may be delayed by as much as 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of this time was due to the Crusades when people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming which aims to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming, often organic, is a simple system using stored seeds adapted to the local ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yields.
Most farmers were previously engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this situation persists in many developing countries.
Subcultures serve to bring together like-minded individuals who feel alienated by societal norms and allow these norms to develop their own identity.
Subcultures may be differentiated by the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, racial, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership by their use of a style that includes clothing, costumes, and terminology that is both symbolic and distinctive.
One common way they illustrate the important role that socialization plays is by drawing on the unfortunate few cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, suffered from being socially disconnected from the adults in their upbringing.
These children became known as "wild" or feral. Some feral children were confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the child was abandoned because the parents objected to the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Feral children may have been abused during childhood or may have experienced severe trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
It is doubtful that they were domesticated by other animals; some say that some lived in the wild alone.
When raised by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that resemble those of a pet animal, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning but is primarily an auxiliary means of providing support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be both virtual and physical, in which case the teacher is considered a form of interactive learning, such as a paper clipper in Microsoft Office.
Internal learning in the program is internally supported and aims to ask questions, motivate, and explain actions that may be difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Families are placed in state care because they face such things as neglect, harm, and even extortion.
It is simply not good for any child to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing and educational, but they do.
We know that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Substitute care must provide all the necessities that they lost in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of mass and personal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the concept of "uses and benefits".
For example, some argue that learning and socialization are key drivers for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and ongoing relationships were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reaction to websites.
The use of these video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions of the eye, which are eye movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying or not by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks argued in his paper that the president's speech implied that people who could not understand speech due to brain damage would be able to judge loyalty more credibly.
He proposes that these abilities to analyze human behavior are shared with some animals such as pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research has demonstrated the existence of two groups of Chinese varieties: a hidden group and an apparent one.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, but selection removes it from the pool of expressive variation.
The processes of segregation and recombination eliminate the back-and-forth random variation between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, primate mammals with a digestive system like that of humans have difficulty meeting their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Failure to do so can lead to serious consequences such as stunted growth, malnutrition and eventually death.
The most accessible plant resources are proteins that can be obtained from leaves and seeds, but these proteins are difficult for primates to digest unless cooked.
On the other hand, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
When we put things in perspective, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to chimpanzees on the savannah.
A sleep disorder is an intentional awakening during sleep after a short period of sleep (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively mild stimulant to bring you back to consciousness without waking you from sleep.
If you find yourself putting the clock back while you are asleep, it may land on the other side of the room, forcing you out of bed to stop it.
Options based on circadian rhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, when one is forced to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The less stress, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the latent potential to enjoy lasting peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve what they want. But the only thing that stands in the way of our goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extended through the Mahayana path of love and other styles derived from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting and visualizations, with Kundalini Yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Baikonur God Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a consciousness for enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and this created cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, but when the war ended, differences in systems, procedures, and cultures caused conflict between the two nations to re-emerge.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
This war was to last for the next 40 years, and the fighting would be done on the ground, with proxy armies from Africa and Asia present on the battlefields of Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Roman bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army troops entered the Soviet Union and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The function of a navy has traditionally been to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, disrupting your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
A notable recent example is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
The German navy was attempting to prevent the occupation by using submarines at this time.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to reach Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used it to easily transport milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were raised in scattered herds on the hills and other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were children or adolescents, such as the well-known shepherd, and these methods of herding are still used today.
Carriage roads in England were built as early as the 16th century.
Although early stagecoaches were simply wooden planks stacked together, horses provided an advantage in that they were fast and could pull relatively light loads compared to the rough roads of the day.
Crossbeams were initially introduced purely to hold the rails in place. But gradually it was realized that if an iron bar was mounted over the tracks, it would be more efficient.
This became a common practice, but iron caused corrosion of the wooden wheels of chariots.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the earliest form of transportation, and humans began walking upright two million years ago, around the time that Homo erectus (meaning "standing man") appeared.
The ancestors of Australopithecus did not walk as straight as they used to.
There are also bipedal forms in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Coelenthropus may have been bipedal as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become active to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly the same as treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, we should go to the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly because of human scientific and technological progress, and the problems have become greater because of human population growth and affluent lifestyles.
After Congress was alerted on July 4 that a handwritten draft of a proclamation from Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thompson some distance from the buildings had been sent to John Dunlap's printing press.
At night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap's Critical Leaflets.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9; a copy reached London on August 10.
The twenty-five Dunlap folios represent the earliest surviving copies of a document of the American Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version is missing.
Many modern paleontologists are confident that only one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day. We call them birds.
They are often mistaken for dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there is a lot about birds that is still almost dinosaur-like.
They have webbed feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like Tyrannosaurus.
All computers using virtual reality rely on processing information encoded in binary form.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and the digits are referred to as binary digits - or bits, using computer language.
Internal poisoning may not show symptoms in time. An immediate diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently common.
The best indicator of indoor poisoning may be an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
See the ticket for first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in its formal sense to refer to these groups of insects.
The term comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, insects highly adapted to infest humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs have characteristics such as the length of their incubation period, and may also live in their host's nest or habitat.
The United States alone has about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease of the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
There is a man and a woman who feel that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their young child to raise a young child.
Couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
In the process of adoption, the original parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works using a scientific approach. This approach actually guides most scientific research.
It is not unique in this regard, however, and experimentation is a test that can be used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific subjects, even psychology.
As the level of knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend heavily on the presence of autonomic cycles and are produced by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that run for a period of consecutive cycles even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the important pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
Two experiments were conducted to distinguish whether they used radioactive phosphorus phage DNA, or radioactive sulfur phage protein.
Mutations can have a range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether or not the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations at a secondary site can cause apoptosis or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife flora and fauna.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and learning about the ecosystem.
Examples include visiting, photographing and getting to know the Bornean orangutan.
People walk from small towns in their cars every morning to their workplaces and meet other people on the way who work in the place they just passed.
In this dynamic mode of transport, each supports and is connected to its own vehicle-based transport system.
Science now suggests that this carbon-based mega-economy knocked the atmosphere out of its steady state, which had supported human evolution over the previous two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Everyone complains about transportation systems.
You rarely hear in developed countries similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or the bridges that fall.
Why do transportation systems cause these complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more important going on?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers always tend to behave rationally; therefore traffic remains balanced, and can be represented in a purely approximate way.
To better illustrate traffic flow, it shows relationships between the three main properties: (1) flow (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and access food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back along their body.
This gives them a larger variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Many years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people saw that he was right but many saw the opposite, that the solar system revolved around the Earth including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems to make sense, because you don't feel the earth move, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It has 8 times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, at over 6 miles wide.
Twenty percent of all the water that pours from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River, praise God.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of tributaries.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza are unsurpassed in size and engineering excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the traces of their predecessors, which lasted over a thousand years.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world by both area and population.
Vatican City uses Italian as its official language for legislation and communication.
Italian is also the language of everyday life used by most who work in the country, but Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known that it contains basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, so all of these elements can be detected in nature in their native form and can be extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also assumed that they would morph into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys were originally a mixture of two or more metals. Alloys contain many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Of course, there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
You can also take alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
On the other hand, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
Unfortunately, as new writing instruments appeared, the pencil declined in popularity and is now rarely used.
People can now type messages on a computer screen without having to use a keyboard.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something more modern comes along.
A fission bomb works by collecting energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
It's like you're rolling a heavy car up a hill. The nucleus splits again and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to disintegrate with little or no movement.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker below the highlands.
There may have been more lunar maria on the near side because the crust was thinner and it was easier for lava to come to the surface.
Content theories focus on what attracts and arouses people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that become self-evident as soon as they reach adulthood.
These theories deal with the issue of why people do what they do, and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory.
In general, there are two behaviors that may emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues; one is to try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performance reviews, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, one becomes unrecognizable and feels the need to change everything the group was doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams fall under the same criteria of excellence as traditional teams, but have subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical communities.
They often have more autonomy than members of traditional teams because their teams may be assembled in different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a true invisible team has been described by Larson and LaVasto, 1989, p109 as an unprecedented component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports, and which performs the task of setting each member's standards.
Why would an organization want to create a learning organization in a time-consuming process? Innovation is one of the goals of applying institutional learning concepts.
When all available resources are effectively utilized by functional departments in an organization, creativity and efficiency can be achieved.
As a result, collaboration within an organization to overcome difficulties can lead to an innovative new process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organization is able to innovate, management must create a culture of innovation and knowledge sharing as well as education for the organization.
Angel (2006) describes a method called continuity and uses it to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience-related data provide concrete evidence for the theoretical approach when seeking knowledge. It thus serves to reduce the search area and make it more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore structures and processes of the brain as never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI largely resembles science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research aims to make machines perform tasks in an automated manner and this requires an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as being able to recognize handwriting, voice, and facial expressions.
These things became separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is currently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is also used to build software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any semester. Often a teacher may want to take her students to places she would not go by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates.
Participating in a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennett School each year in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are kept online as a record.
Blogs can help improve students' writing. When students start blogging their experience is often sloppy, but the presence of an audience changes all that.
Since students are the most frequently criticized audience, the blogger tries to write better so as not to be criticized.
Blogs also "force students to be smart about the world around them". They are motivated to feed the public's interest and make students resourceful and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that allows people to collaborate and encourages students to continue learning beyond the regular school day.
Proper use of blogs enables students to be more analytical and critical by responding effectively to online material, determining their attitude towards the writings of others, as well as presenting their own views on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive bilingual capital and home to some of the finest art galleries and museums that illustrate Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is located in the far south, and the north is an area of untapped natural beauty to Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more are Ontario as seen by outsiders of Japanese Canadian descent.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated and some are semi-deserted.
For a population comparison that surprises many: the African American population in America is larger than the Canadian population.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
The island of Madagascar is the largest island, and is considered a separate continent for its wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent countries or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Islam was brought to the country by the Arabs, and spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama successfully navigated the Cape Route connecting Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the African coast and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For statuses: Regardless of actual marital status, traveling statuses must declare that they are married.
It helps if she wears a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to know that cultural differences can cause harassment and that it is normal to be followed, held by the arm, etc.
You should be firm in front of men, and not afraid to stand your ground (cultural or other differences make this unacceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic ambush point called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badia, and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is not one of the most attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
One can easily find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods in every corner of the city, such as crockery, pottery, leather goods, shisha and all cheap items, but all this is only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is located in the far east near Rwanda.
The 2002 Nyiragongo volcanic eruption devastated Goma, covering most of the city and much of the central part of the country.
Any visits outside Goma should be sought to understand the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province, while Goma is reasonably safe.
The city is a base for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can ride a boda boda (a motorcycle that doubles as a taxi) to get around the city of Goma, and the average price (local) is about 500 CFA for a short ride.
The region of "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for distant foreign lands because it is difficult to reach.
The modern city of Timbuktu is a poor town, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and having an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
One of Henry Louis Gates' key stops on the PBS series was on the wonders of the African private world.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it is more Arab than African in character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's most visited attractions, and is considered one of South Africa's finest national parks.
There are maintenance and entrance fees charged at the park like all public parks found in South Africa.
It is a good idea to buy a Wild Card, as it gives you access to a selection of South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to Hong Kong Territory and is where many tourists find a major attraction.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline resemble a shimmering chart that appears over the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to Kowloon Waterfront on the other side.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the North Shore.
This is the area that the British colonists used as their private space, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is considered the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending for 80 km (50 mi) into areas off the coasts of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian territory of the Sundarbans National Park is named after it.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they contain the last evidence of the dense forest that once covered the Ganges.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about a third of which is water and swampland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
Buses run from the inter-district bus station (via the river) throughout the day although most, especially those going east and Jakkar/Bumthang run between 06:30 and 07:30.
The buses that go between the districts are very crowded, and it is best to buy tickets well in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese-style coaster buses that are comfortable and powerful.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Bonha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oiapoque River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and São Jorge do Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints will also be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the area now known as eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaicuru and Payagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, previously called the "Giant Province of the Indians", arose in the 16th century due to the confrontation of Spanish invaders and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is world-famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
This year's major tournament will be held in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches can be played here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the islands' only bank located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
You can transact in pounds everywhere on the island, and Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are also widely used.
In the outer islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners beforehand to find out what payment methods are accepted.
It is impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so money must be exchanged before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it experiences summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in the subtropics; temperatures often exceed 30 °C in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity leave them colder than the thermometer indicates.
The amount of rainfall remains constant throughout the year, while there are no specific "wet" and "dry" seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is ultimately wild and cannot be fed or disturbed.
According to the park service, you should stay at least 100 yards away from bears and cougars and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how easy they seem to attract, bison, elk, moose, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Many visitors each year are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, ferocious and potentially dangerous and must be given space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so do not carry or cook odorous foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1950s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of notorious naval confrontations in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave port.
All but one British warship were sunk. About 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the Maoist movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the assassination of leader Topo Tamasese Lilufi III.
Because Auckland is located between two harbours, it has many beaches, the most popular being located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy allowing safe swimming, and most are shaded by baobab trees.
The Tamaki Road beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded with a good selection of shops lining the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main folk beer is called "Number One", it is not a complex drink, but it is a fun and refreshing drink. The other local beer is Manta.
French wines are plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more common.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but it is easy to find bottled water, if you are worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A small black coffee is an espresso, a cappuccino is topped with a layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent although expensive.
Many trips to the reef are year-round, and there is rarely any damage to the reef for any reason.
However, seek advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found along beaches and estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can be found hours at a time outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles do not normally live in the ocean, but their main habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance ensures that the traveler will have a place to sleep when they first arrive at their destination.
Although you can find other types of accommodation reservations, such as campsites through a travel agent, travel agents often deal with specific hotels.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport or even combined airline and hotel packages.
They can hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get additional paperwork for your destination (such as a visa).
However, any changes or requests must first be made through the travel agent and not through the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of people attending music festivals decide to camp on site and consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should go early to get a campsite near the museum.
Keep in mind that the music on the main stages may have ended, but some sections of the festival may continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, you should check the cabin location, as crossing through the ice causes loud noises that can seriously affect people.
Saint Petersburg cruises involve spending a certain amount of time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see requirements again).
Casinos usually make an effort to accommodate the time and money spent by guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment, to put guests in a good mood and keep them in the building.
Some places keep free alcoholic beverages, but alcohol impairs good judgment and all sensible gamblers know the importance of keeping the gambler sober.
If you are driving your car at high altitudes or over mountain passes, you should consider the possibility of snow or ice or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you will not feel as if you are driving on smooth asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow may fall to block the road in a very short time.
Snowfall, blizzard conditions, condensation, or snow on vehicle windows can cause limited visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourist attraction in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The term safari is often used to refer to cross-country travel to view the spectacular wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to be very close to vehicles and standard equipment allows good viewing.
Lions, leopards and tigers are often shy and are best seen with binoculars.
Hiking safaris (also called "walking safaris" or "walking tours" or "walks") are long walks that can last for hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other locations in different parts of Japan.
After Tokyo hosted the 1964 Olympics, it remains the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice.
If you book your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may face an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies will not take effect until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets will cost around 7,000 yen.
Keep wet clothes dry. Many hotels have an iron and a table that can be borrowed, even if no one is in the room.
If there is no iron or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try using an air dryer if one is available.
Do not let the fabric get too hot (as this can cause it to shrink or burn in the worst cases).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, in others it must be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies. If you are concerned, you should buy water in certified sizes from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unknown in their native regions.
Pesticides can contaminate food, cause irritation, worsen allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can forcibly infect or kill people are not normally described as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in limited areas only.
Travelers to a highly taxed country can, and often do, save a significant amount of money, especially on spending on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Vermont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it regularly passes through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, you should be careful, as there are often steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and later sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and basic adherence to them is more important than anything else.
However, cell phone service is much stronger here than at the other end of the route, such as Prairie, Pennsylvania.
German pastries such as those from Aue and Bavaria have many and varied uses, as do pastries from its southern neighbour Austria.
Fruitcake is popular; apples are baked in the cake year-round, and cherries and plums appear in summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other types of nuts. The traditional cake is often eaten with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small, rich pastries, try the ones called Berliner, Fankuchen or Krabben depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices, meat and vegetables.
Curry seasonings can be "dry" or sometimes "wet" depending on the liquid present.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used with curry, and in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian food has now become a catch-all term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines spread throughout Indonesia, due to the 17,000 islands in Indonesia to differentiate them.
Used without further qualification, however, the term tends to imply that the food originated in the central and eastern regions of the large island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of lightly spiced dishes, the popular flavors preferred by Javanese include peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that remain suspended from the saddlebags.
They provide a lot of stability for the rider but can have safety concerns due to the possibility that the rider's man may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but lets go of a leg caught in the bridle, the horse may be dragged away. Some safety precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
Initially most equestrians wear riding boots that have very soft and narrow heels and soles.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the passenger's fur to fall out of the saddle as soon as it is pulled back as soon as the passenger gets off.
The Cachamo Valley is the first place that comes to mind when talking about climbing in Chile, and is known as Yosemite in South America, with many large granite walls and boulders.
The peaks have spectacular views from the top. Climbers from all over the world are constantly making new routes between the many walls with unprecedented potential.
Snow sports on slopes, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports such as sliding on snow-covered ground with skis or skateboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", who plan to spend entire vacations skiing only in a particular location.
The idea of skating is very old - cave paintings depicting skaters date back to 5000 BC!
The history of downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Definition of backpacking: This activity is also called downhill skiing, ski trips, or hiking.
It is related to alpine ski touring or mountaineering, but does not normally include ski touring or mountaineering, as they require steep or sloping terrain and require stiff skis and boots.
Think of a cross-country ski trail as a long-distance semi-walking trail.
In good conditions, it will be able to cover longer distances than walking, but will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on groomed trails.
Europe is a small continent but it has a large number of independent countries. In normal circumstances when you travel and pass through many countries it means that you have to apply for visas and go through passport control every now and then.
