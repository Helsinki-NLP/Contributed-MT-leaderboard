In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared it to three other therapies.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely held, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional appearance.
Scientists say the animal's feathers were chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid underneath.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called the main shaft, but have other features of feathers - soft hairs and soft bristles - the researchers concluded that the main shaft likely represented a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for thermoregulation or feathering. The researchers pointed out that although this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult feathers, not those of a chicken.
The researchers pointed out that although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers, not those of a chicken.
A car bomb detonated at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than 20 other people.

The work achieved is mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team expects should be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon affects the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists could deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is in a kind of halo around it, and it's made up of many small particles.

Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following special procedures.

She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from witnesses could be called into question because her picture is posted everywhere.
This is common throughout the UK, but the Scottish legal system is different and the courts consider the publication of images to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "it does seem that journalists are treading a fine line if they publish photos etc. of suspects".
The state prosecutor's office, which has full jurisdiction over the prosecution, indicated to reporters that there would be no further comment at least until the indictment.
According to the source, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to go back to the period before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly include the future state of Jerusalem, which is a holy site for both nations, and the Jordan River Valley dispute.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of 10 years after an agreement is signed while the Palestinian Authority agrees to leave that presence only for a period of five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control trial were to be under strict supervision by the rangers as the trial was observed and its effectiveness assessed.
Under the Sport Hunting Association's hunting program, in collaboration with the NPWS and the Sport Hunting Association of Australia (SHA), qualified volunteers have joined.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at the NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelli yesterday took the oath of office for a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Commission (CEC).
This is Martelli's fifth Temporary Select Committee in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission suggested SER resign earlier as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
With the Martelly Commission, he was actually reacting to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests have been sparked by the failure to hold elections, and some date back as far as 2011.
Some 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 appliance-related accidents.
Last week, MIT announced that it had received notification from Apple of 34 more cases of overheating, which the company considered "non-serious".
In its response, the Ministry called the delay of the Apple report "really regrettable".
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 am (09:19 pm GMT Friday).
Representatives of the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are now confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched the scene with an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that administering the hormone would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorder "black boxes" in the middle.
Luna was also honored by fellow fighters.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night she was two months old. Quite unique just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was on the sidelines like me ... maybe more ... I love her and will miss her ... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign argued that she thought Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
Reflecting the extremes noted in the poll, 29 percent of respondents felt that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent felt that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have cast doubt on his fitness.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to overcome the pain because it was banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were the source of Earth's water supply, in addition to organic matter that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, specifically, how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill allowing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to help air traffic controllers locate aircraft more precisely and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport has been arranged, and underground trains will not stop at Wembley and parking spaces and public transport interchanges are not available at the stadium.
The fear of not having transportation increased the possibility of the match being held behind closed doors without the team's fans.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to have taken much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Galapagos finch, Geospiza fortis, and the large cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape, it can be bent into small shapes.
It can be dragged on a thin wire, which can be twisted and twisted, it can be hammered or stretched into layers.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate handmade pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH, and you can make an indicator out of red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons stripped from them (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with clean, wet hands, roll them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which you'll feel unusually, and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in Minoan-era cities on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, in some situations toilets were part of public baths where both men and women went together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then bounces it back almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the best thing it's done for us is it's made transportation easier and faster.
He provided the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming pet cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a domain, a special thing that every cat has that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats living in large groups called prides.
The herd consists of one to three blood-related males, along with up to thirty females and juveniles.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions acts much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, as well as very deadly to their prey.
A skilled athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of the strongest man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) with lions, leopards and jaguars.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion but is more like a series of words that resemble a roar and a loud cry.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals the ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find prey by scent, sniffing the ground where they have been.
They see well in the dark with night vision and move stealthily as well. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into the surroundings and then grabbing their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river or if it moves to a new island where it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in an environment different from the one it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor, compared to what it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment and begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
Our homes are made from plants, our clothes are made from plants, plants make up most of the food we eat, animals couldn't survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with another row at the top of its mouth, meant that it was no match for anything in its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may even have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex was no match for it.
While much of the food was familiar, the Romans had their own strange or exotic delicacies, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a pollux.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate their meals seated on stools, wealthy people preferred to have communal meals, where they would rest on couches while eating their meals.
The dishes of Ancient Rome certainly did not contain products that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was viewed as the home of that deity.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to minister to the needs of the gods by means of rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes separate pyramidlike elevations, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the mound was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Much of the life of an ancient Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just stalls out in the open facing the street.
The land of Canaan was sparsely forested, and timber was expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in Norse legend, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each of the countries was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might believe that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that initially the large parchment (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
So it is possible that the note was written simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was run by the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies entered Southern France, and the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were marching into Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shaped by a significantly large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", meaning "civil", related to the Latin word "civis", meaning "citizen", and "civitas", meaning "city" or "city-state", and that sort of defines the size of a society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. Civilizational culture presupposes the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a long-lasting cultural imprint and a fairly large spread.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - the only component being Congress - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, lacking a national executive or judicial branch, relied on often uncooperative state governments to enforce all its laws.
Nor did it have the authority to waive the laws on taxes and duties between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states perceived the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, it is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago".
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a change in local grain-processing habits and employing Chinese labourers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took over the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists an idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still-image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of a digital camera.
The 35mm format is actually quite confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (which divides by twelve to get the simplest integer size) is therefore considered to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format group) are equal to or significantly approximate the ratio.
The most abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple rule that creates dynamics while maintaining order in the picture.
It points out that it is most efficient to place the main subject at the intersection of the lines that divide the picture into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Roman Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was under attack.
Despite differences in language and culture, the Christian religion held Europe together for over a thousand years.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should be used only for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and such concentration of power and money has caused many to question whether the principles are being met.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, cutting off essential supplies to the military and civilians, although the blockade violates generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since there were few opportunities to respond to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, attitudes of pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nations.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a collection of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these phases was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Qin dynasty.
In this period there were heavy struggles between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, when thousands died in the struggle to sit atop the great palace in Xi'an.
There are numerous social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to all the people, not just to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the army because, instead of rank in the army being based on class, it was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this earthly life. He often went to a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) to meditate.
He locked himself in a cave, which has survived the passage of time, providing a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not at all easy to find even if someone knew you were fasting.
Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
Of the Seven Wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza remains today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of a number of large pyramidal structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The "Giza Plateau" or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of Death, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper arm" mark resembles the letter V, and the "lower arm" mark a joint or square missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the top and push the string, and down means you should start at the fretboard (where your hand holds the string) and pull the string.
The upstroke produces a softer sound, while the downstroke is louder and more aggressive.
Feel free to write down your own signs, but remember, printed notes are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year-old Marie-Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forcibly returned to Paris, from Versailles, by a group of market women on 6 October 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd that was shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to throw open their carriage windows.
At one point, a man in the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The military costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to defray most of the costs, and the interest on the bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the super profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos were a major benefit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The time when the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from a technological drive or technological imperative to a strong sense that human destiny is guided by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology, in itself, follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence and that technology, in turn, has "influences" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new methods are being worked on in manufacturing to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increased frequency of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to rehabilitate injured bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, taken up by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography created individuals, and over time customs and culture related to geography emerged, so in harmony with the place of society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status deteriorated during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, that were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
During this period the title Capital of Fashion shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western fashion was sometimes 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at the time, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Existential farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses stored seed originating from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel disregarded by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be diverse as a result of the age, ethnic group, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style encompassing fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look back at several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, poverty, or deliberate mistreatment by adults, remained unsocialized as they grew up.
Some feral children were confined by humans (most often by their parents); in some cases this abandonment of the child was the result of the parents' rejection of the child's serious mental or physical disability.
Rude children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully grown by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost the same as the animal that cared for it, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, a technique called scaffolding goes a step further.
The technique called "scaffolding" is not a learning method but an auxiliary tool that provides support for individuals going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, but so is the connector guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software and is intended to interrogate, stimulate and explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to master on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages or foster homes for reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but growing nonetheless.
We think foster care is a safe zone for these kids.
Our care system needs to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and a reliable healthcare system.
Care should provide all the needs they lacked in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet contains elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and access to content.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" have been proposed as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Both Amy and McCord (1998) identify "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational aspects, exploring audience reactions to websites.
Using video has led to significant breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one could detect if someone is lying by accurately interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book "The President's Speech", pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately judge sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection allows expressed variations to be removed from the group.
Segregation and recombination move variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so would have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and pods, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep onset is the process of purposefully waking up during your normal sleep and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm to wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you accidentally stop your watch while sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you will have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which causes a person to have to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The less pressure, the more positive the life force present, each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of our goal is pressure and negativity from ourselves.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, which were expanded by the Mahayana path of love and a host of techniques from Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is "divine yoga". Through the visualization of several deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. After the war ended, differences in systems, processes and culture led to disagreements between the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was going to last for the next 40 years, and it was going to involve real fighting, with proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and a host of other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense force was already defeated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Roman Bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern parts of Poland, violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Transporting goods by ship is definitely the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The job of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and your goods, while at the same time, making it more difficult for the enemy to move their people and their goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies were defeated, Germany could probably conquer Britain just as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and leather.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or pastures, tended by goatherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the better-known shepherds.
Horse-drawn trams were developed in England in the 16th century.
Although wagons were mainly constructed of parallel wooden planks, they could be pulled by horses for greater speed and to haul a greater load than was possible on the poor roads of the day.
Railroad ties were originally used to hold the rails in place; however, it was gradually realized that rails would be more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels than the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first train with all-iron wheels was launched.
The first known mode of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, were not so used to walking upright.
Bipedal adaptations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start acting more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and maybe even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
In many cases, this is the same as treating the symptoms; however, if a temporary solution is not sought, then the root of the problem must be identified and eliminated.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advancement, and the problems have been made worse by mankind's overpopulation and extravagant life-style.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the draft in manuscript, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomas, was sent a few streets away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap Pages.
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Building on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his troops in New York on July 9, and arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Papers that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and move around on their two hind legs like T. rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the management of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or, if computer jargon is used, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general, so a diagnosis may not be immediately made.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Look on the label for specific first aid instructions for the particular poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term beetle in a formal sense.
This term derives from the ancient resemblance to bed bugs, which are insects well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both bed bugs and parasites are nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or to house their host.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples have the opportunity to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can have custody of the child.
The main goal of science is to learn about the way the world works through the scientific method.
But, however, it's not just that, it's also experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, as well as observation, also drive scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, with particular emphasis on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
A multitude of observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often knowingly depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free cycling even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading hypotheses that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to embed their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they labeled either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are sex cells.
Only mutated genetic cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutated cells elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and pass others whose destination for work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shared transportation, everyone is connected in some way and supports the private car-based transportation system.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everybody participates in society and uses transportation systems.
Rarely in the developed world do we hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints, why do they disappoint every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers know to stick to a reasonably constant frame; thus, traffic flows know to have a certain reasonable constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better visualize traffic flow, relationships are established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to evade predators and more efficiently find food and mates.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their body.
This provides them with a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, being six miles wide in places.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans originates in the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which by then were more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and least populous country.
The Vatican's legislation and official communication are in Italian.
Italian is also used in everyday life by people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these can all be found in nature in raw form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle thought that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
It is something like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gases and plasma, although he also thought that they change into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are actually a mixture of two or more metals.
Metals include elements such as calcium and potassium, as well as metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil became a good friend to many when it appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil's status and use declined.
People now type messages on a computer and never have to go near a sharpener again.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The physics bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to create a nucleus of many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and then as the core re-splits, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they have a tendency to decay with or without little nudging.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more basaltic plain on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what excites people or what they like.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted as they mature from children to adults.
These theories look at what makes some people like the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
The two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two types of behavior can occur when managers start managing their former coworkers: On the one hand, it is an attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performing performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable for their actions.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable person who thinks he or she has to change everything the team did and make it his or her own.
However, the leader has ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in conflict between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams operate to the same standards of excellence as standard teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet depending on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an exceptional component of a virtual team.
The management team is the "invisible team" to which each member reports. It is the visible team that sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity flourish.
As a result, an organization's collaborative process of overcoming a barrier can lead to a new innovative process for serving customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, along with shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, therefore narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes in the brain.
This provides a lot of information and material for creating simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to users' diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become discrete disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
After being incorporated into several software applications for home computers and video games, AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Very often, the teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips, where students can explore museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
And sharing a virtual field trip is a good way to reminisce about the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capital, every year the website is reconstructed, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs also help improve students' writing.Although students often start the blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of the audience mainly changes that.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can encourage students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to material on the Internet, students can define their positions in the context of the written texts of others, as well as highlight their own views on particular issues (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, featuring an array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and many more make Ontario perfectly Canadian, as foreigners see it.
Large areas in the north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent in terms of animal life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it soon spread to Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment and that it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stick to your guns (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan revived the city as Daru I-Badja, but it was given the name Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases here.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajine pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of inexpensive trinkets, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far eastern parts near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that flooded most of the city streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma should be checked to know the state of unrest that persists in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for trekking to the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although the city is a tourist attraction and has an airport, today Timbuktu is an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
He was one of the main characters during the PBS special, "The Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is a stark contrast to other cities in the country, because it has more Arab charm than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of the Republic of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers some 7,500 square miles [19,500 sq km] and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with its own wildlife.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the forerunner of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance fees and park entrance fees.
It may also be helpful to purchase a "wild card" that allows entry into any park in South Africa or into all of South Africa's national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong derives its name from Hong Kong Island and it is the place that is the main focus of many tourists.
The arrangement of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a shimmering graph that stands out in the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast at Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on the parched land along the northern coast.
It's where the British colonists settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the longest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast, into the Bangladeshi and Indian interior.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they encompass some of the last remaining strongholds of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges Basin.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 caribou now live in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those travelling east and Jakhar/Bumtang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In most areas small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and sturdy, are used.
Taxi sharing is a fast and efficient way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 NGR) and Punakha (200 NGR).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Oiapoque River and connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two paths 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The plan is for the bridge to be fully functional in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Province of Southeast Asia", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquerors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted more than three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December on the polo grounds of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions at other times of the year can also be seen here.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo (Argentine Polo Association).
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is equal to that of one British pound (GBP).
Money is exchanged at the islands' only bank located in Stanley, right across from FIC West.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and as part of Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on outlying islands, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine which method of payment is acceptable to you.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; temperatures over 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically "wet" or "dry" periods: the amount of rainfall remains relatively the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park service guidelines, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how tame they may seem, bison, moose, bears, and almost any large animal could attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the harbor experienced its infamous naval standoff when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships sunk except one British battleship with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town ended with the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lyaoloufi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland encompasses two harbours.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbor district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches safe for swimming, and most are shaded by trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Messina Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a good selection of shops along the shore.
The most famous local beer is called Nambar Wan, which is not heavy, but a pleasant and refreshing beer.
There are a lot of French wines you can take, but wines from New Zealand and Australia can travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water can be easily obtained if you are wary.
The idea of "plain white" coffee is foreign to Australians - the short black is an espresso, the cappuccino is heavy on the cream (not the foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is made according to Belgian standards.
Trips to the reef are frequent throughout the year and reef injuries are rare.
Still, accept the advice of authorities, obey all signs, and heed safety warnings.
The box jellyfish appears along beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but, however, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and just swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live permanently in the ocean, their primary habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, the traveler can rest assured that he will have a place to sleep as soon as he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents usually have contracts with certain hotels, although you can also book accommodation elsewhere, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also hold your reservation if you need some time to think about the offer or to provide other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
All changes and additions or requests should first be checked with the travel agent, not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the action as possible, you'll have to get there early and get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has ended, there are parts of the festival that play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location because crossing ice creates a terrible sound for the most vulnerable.
St. Petersburg cruises include a passage through the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests in the mood to stay.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is low and cannot be driven as on asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or accumulating snow or by condensation or frost on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic moves almost unhindered year-round.
The safari is perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the most outstanding for many visitors.
The popular meaning of the term safari refers to an overland journey to observe Africa's magnificent wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles more closely, so even standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a ""wildlife walk"", ""hiking safari"" or walking ""walk"") consists of walking, either for several hours or several days".
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 games.
If you have booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
There are variations in cancellation policies but as of late March, most coronavirus-induced cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that are available to borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, then you can try a hair dryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to get the material too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
Although there are various methods of water purification, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water takes only a minute, while in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, which you should be concerned about, and you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are absent in the regions from which they come.
Parasites can spoil food, cause inflammation or, in more serious cases, allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill a human, are not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from paying taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers who travel to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The train from Point Marion to Fairmont has the most exciting driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, passing through isolated woodlands.
If you are not used to driving on a country road, beware: steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp curves dominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent section, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), so strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Yet, miraculously, the cell signal is much stronger here than in other areas, like the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit cakes are usually made with apple dough throughout the year, and in summer they can be found with cherries and plums.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you like small but rich pastries, try these, called berliner, fankuchen, or krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish of herbs and spices, containing meat or vegetables.
The dish can be "dry" or "smooth", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the mainland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used to prepare curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
The word Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation of 17,000 islands.
But if used without additional attributes, the term usually means food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine displays a selection of simply spiced meals, the most dominant flavors of Javanese cuisine are peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The bridles support the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider, but there may also be safety concerns due to the likelihood of their feet getting stuck in them.
If a horse throws the rider, but the rider's foot gets caught in the rein, if the horse escapes, it is possible for the rider to be dragged.
First, most riders wear high-heeled boots with smooth, very narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety handles that allow the harness strap to fall off the saddle if it pulls the rider in a fall.
Cochami Valley - Chile's premier hiking destination, known as the Yosemites of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and crevices.
The peaks offer breathtaking views and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes through the endless potential of the mountain sides.
Winter alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you ski or snowboard on snowy terrain with your feet.
"Skiing is a major travel activity for many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums", whose entire vacation revolves around skiing at a particular location".
The notion of skiing is very old - there are cave paintings of skiers as far back as 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski walking.
It is related to but does not always include alpine skiing or mountaineering, which are performed on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you could cover greater distances than by walking - but you would rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on paved trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent states.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean repeatedly submitting to visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, acts somewhat like a single state in this respect.
As long as you are in this zone, you can generally cross borders without repeatedly passing through passport control.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen Member State separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition according to which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define as antiques items that are over 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographical location with the age limit may be shorter in North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
