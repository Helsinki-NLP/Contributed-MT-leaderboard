Four members of the Kemerovo Group detained in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, police in Spain have arrested Slava Gulevich, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the court's permission.
Yesterday, the court also remanded three suspects held in Estonia.
They are suspected to be members of the so-called Kemerovo crime syndicate, aged between 27 and 57, who are mainly involved in drug offences.
In Mijas, in the province of Malaga, Spain, an alleged leader of a criminal organization was arrested.
In Estonia, three men were arrested as suspects, one of whom is reportedly the leader of a criminal organisation and two of whom are members of a criminal organisation.
The information gathered suggests that there was a clear allocation of tasks and roles within the criminal organisation.
The activities of the criminal group were aimed at committing drug offences and thereby earning criminal proceeds,' commented the head of the pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case, State Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out that the number of suspects in this criminal case will increase", the prosecutor added.
These are people who have previously come to the attention of law enforcement authorities, some of whom have been convicted of drug offences.
Verte emphasised that cooperation with Spanish counterparts has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become routine for us and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation", commented Prosecutor Verte.
The head of the Central Criminal Police Agency, Ago Leis, said that the arrests followed a preliminary investigation that lasted nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, we carried out a long-term operation and arrested suspects in Estonia and Spain at the same time", he said.
Mr Le added that officers from the Central Criminal Police had assisted in the arrests in Spain.
For many years we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and Civil Guard.
These arrests are another message to criminals that we can get them on the other side of Europe,' said Leis.
The information gathered so far strongly suggests that while at liberty the suspects may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecution requested and the court approved their arrest.
The man arrested in Spain is awaiting extradition to Estonia.
In the framework of this criminal case, real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized in order to ensure confiscation.
Pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters are conducted by the Organised Crime Bureau of the Central Criminal Police and directed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Originally from Kemerovo, Gulevich rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly collected taxes from taxi drivers and prostitutes working at various hotels, and he charged businessmen a monthly roofing fee.
International joint operations, confiscations of proceeds of crime and final court decisions confirm the effectiveness of the fight against organised crime.
For example, the recent judgments in the case of the so-called 'Dikaev criminal group', where eight defendants were acquitted and EUR 80 000 in criminal proceeds were confiscated, or the judgement against nine persons that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal group in 2006 to engage in the illegal trade in contraband cigarettes and to commit crimes related to human trafficking in Ida-Virumaa and southern Estonia.
The amount of confiscated proceeds of crime is nearly EUR 71 500.
The daily exchange of information between police officers and their foreign counterparts, the exchange of evidence between prosecutors and, where necessary, joint operations in any EU country have ensured the success of these criminal cases.
A civil rights group is warning against travel to Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black travelers to Missouri of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which is in effect through August 28, 2017, urges all African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to exercise extreme caution and extreme caution while traveling throughout the state in light of a series of racially charged incidents that have recently occurred across the state and have been reported here".
According to the NAACP, the group was prompted to issue the travel warning by a recent Missouri law that makes it harder to win discrimination lawsuits and by the fact that minorities are disproportionately targeted by state law enforcement.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled over because of the color of their skin, beaten or killed", said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri chapter of the NAACP, in The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had so many complaints before".
This is the first such warning the organization has issued for a U.S. state.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died earlier this year under suspicious circumstances after he ran out of gas driving across state lines and Missouri State Police took him into custody without charging him with a crime.
In addition, the memo cites a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General showing that black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be pulled over than their white counterparts.
"The purpose of the notice is to make people aware and to warn their families, friends and co-workers of what may happen in Missouri", Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared, whether that means bringing bail money or notifying relatives that they're crossing state lines".
According to the most recent data from the FBI's Hate Crimes Reporting Program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, which puts the state 16th in the nation for such violations.
The travel warning is also in response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder to sue a company for discrimination in housing or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, because the ACLU said it increased racial profiling.
Usually, travel warnings are issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have begun using the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Hepatitis: what should everyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different viruses - hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which can progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer, are more costly.
Kuulo Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser at the Health Ministry, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same in all types of hepatitis - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gray stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
Hepatitis is also known as jaundice.
In children, hepatitis may be asymptomatic.
The different types of hepatitis can only be identified by laboratory testing.
Acute hepatitis can turn into chronic hepatitis and can go on for decades without symptoms, which means that a person may be unaware of his or her dangerous liver disease.
Kuulo Kutsar highlights the different forms of hepatitis and describes their progression.
Hepatitis A viruses are spread from an infected person to another by eating or drinking contaminated food or water, by having sex, by touching or passing feces from an infected person to food, surfaces, objects, or the mouth, and by taking drugs.
People who are at risk of contracting hepatitis A include family members and caregivers, people with chronic liver disease, people who have sex with people who are infected, men who have sex with men, drug users, and travelers to countries where hepatitis A is common.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, which is particularly recommended for frequent travellers and those at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene is important: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before eating.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread through contact with blood from an infected person, injection of drugs, tattooing, piercing, use of blood-contaminated household items (toothbrushes, razors), donor blood, sexual contact with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from an infected mother to her fetus/ newborn child.
People who are at risk of contracting hepatitis B include injecting drug users, sexual partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns born to infected mothers, family members and caregivers of sick people, health-care workers, emergency workers and police officers who come into contact with blood and other body fluids, and travelers to countries where hepatitis B is common.
Hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccinating people, especially those at risk, but also those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases, and diabetes.
Other prevention measures for hepatitis B include avoidance of needle sharing, tattooing and piercing, use of condoms during risky sex and avoidance of sexual risk behaviours.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation programme in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread through contact with blood from an infected person, injection of drugs, tattooing, piercing, use of blood-contaminated objects, donor blood, sexual contact with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from an infected mother to her fetus/ newborn child.
People who are at risk of contracting hepatitis C include injecting drug users, sexual partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns born to infected mothers, family members and caregivers of sick people, health-care workers, emergency workers and police officers who come into contact with blood and other body fluids, people living with HIV, and travelers to countries where hepatitis C is common.
Prevention of hepatitis C includes avoidance of needle sharing, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condoms during risky sex.
There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D co-infection with hepatitis B or superinfection may occur in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated needles, sexual contact, and, rarely, from an infected mother to her fetus.
People at risk for hepatitis D are chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus and those who are not immune to hepatitis B.
An effective prevention measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects against hepatitis D virus infection.
Hepatitis E viruses are spread by the faecal-oral route through drinking water and food, including the consumption of undercooked meat, fish and shellfish, donor blood, shared needles and from an infected mother to her fetus.
Travelers to countries with a high incidence of hepatitis E can become infected.
Prevention of hepatitis E involves good hygiene: washing or disinfecting hands after using the toilet, before preparing or eating food, and after caring for someone who is sick.
Wash fruits and vegetables before eating, limit your intake of processed meats, fish, and seafood, drink only safe water, and avoid illicit drugs.
Although on the final lap, competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic champion off the track, the 34-year-old Farah found his strength in the final stretch and won in a time of 26:49.51.
Farah didn't think twice about dragging his wife Tania and kids onto the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
Being on the track with them was amazing", Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for his fifth consecutive title in London, a gold double in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite its title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's Lady in Gold: The Extraordinary Story of the Birth of a Masterpiece by Gustav Klimt, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer delves much deeper into the cultural life of Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
But even more deeply into history.
Perhaps a sharper blade would have eliminated the overwhelming amount of information, and a narrower subject would have allowed the extraordinary story portrayed in the title to have greater impact.
Today, it is as if there were two books between the covers: The story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted by Gustav Klimt in his painting The Lady in Gold, and a much larger and more comprehensive history book about respected Jewish families and the German occupation and its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book takes you to the heart of Vienna's vibrant cultural life, and once in the Austrian capital, you can easily imagine what life was like around the Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone in the Café Central got dizzy when Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and seeing a familiar name in a book makes you feel a little more cultured.
On the other hand, the fact that Sigmund Freud worked in a city plagued by incurable syphilis and with the highest suicide rate in Europe does not seem to add anything to the story.
Or maybe it's just that every brushstroke adds color to the cultural life of early 20th-century Vienna.
Dreaming of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the Jewish population of Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, nearly 1 in 10 Viennese was Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele had married twice to the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and posed for Klimt's famous paintings, her father's bank had become the seventh largest in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele was not attracted to the glamorous life she was leading.
Looking at the Lady in Gold, it's hard to believe that at the end of her life this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to commission a portrait of his wife from Klimt, he was the hottest new painter in Vienna.
Klimt's commission cost 4,000 crowns at the time, a quarter of the price of a country house in a good location.
The sugar magnate was not deterred by suspicions of a love affair between the artist and the sitter.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist developed during the work continued for the rest of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Lady in the gold.
The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before beginning work on Adele, Klimt had visited the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and scholars believe that it was the brilliant mosaics of Empress Theodora that inspired the artist to paint a golden portrait of Adele as a mosaic.
Klimt exhibited his "Lady in Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and around the same time (1907-1908), another gold painting, "The Kiss", was born.
Art historians could not help but notice the similarity between the two women.
What's Hitler got to do with it?
"I think that in memory of my friend Klimt I owe it to him to make his handiwork available to the public", Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum, wishing their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt painted another portrait of Adele.
Also in her will (Adele died in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes to the Austrian Gallery.
She left her jewelry to her nieces, Maria and Luisa.
A year after Klimt completed his "Mona Lisa of Austria", 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to enter the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna but failed the drawing exam.
Although Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes attributed to his being rejected by Jewish professors at the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, by 1939, the task of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in Maria's will, had changed significantly - it had become important to find works from Vienna's rich Jewish art collections to please the Nazi Party.
Hitler's personal art collection also included some works from Adele's home, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the Nazis looted the art, a ten-year legal battle began between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs.
Let's just say that if you want to see "The Kiss" at the Belvedere in Vienna, you have to go to the Neue Galerie in New York to see Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Lady in Gold".
And read the aforementioned book before going to Vienna.
Even if you don't plan on going to see the Klimts, because at least my emotions after closing the book revolved more around the Nazi and Jewish themes than the $135 million painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So it's not so much a portrait as it is the story of a family - and a very moving one.
The family tree of the Bauers, given at the beginning of the book, was a remarkable aid in getting our bearings.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada.
In the preliminary heat, Gold came very close to her personal best in the 200-meter backstroke, swimming 2:16.62.
The record was set a week ago by a 17-year-old at the Canadian Junior Championships in 2:16.58, reports Priit Aaviku Ujumisblogi.
Gold came in last, maybe 10th in the A final.
In the final, he completed the distance in a time of 2:15.76, achieving a strong seventh place with a powerful new personal best.
Gold was just over half a second behind Alina Kendzior's Estonian record (2:15.13).
In Estonia's all-time ranking, Gold rose to third place and his fresh personal best is Estonia's fifth all-time result.
The young prospect is yet to compete in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle and the 200 m and 400 m medley at the Canadian Senior Championships.
Last week, Toronto hosted the Canadian Junior Championships, and Gold made a successful start there as well.
She won the silver medal in the 200 m freestyle with a time of 2.03.22.
The last time an Estonian swam this fast was in 2008.
Only the Estonian record holder Elina Partõka has swum this distance faster than Gold.
The Estonian, who lives in Canada, also won a bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season's top mark of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older, has swum this distance just one century faster.
She also set a new personal best in the 100-metre backstroke, recording a time of 1.03.69 in the opening heat of the breaststroke.
At the half-way mark, he only managed seventh place, swimming 2:17.31 in the final.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season standings in four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen their teeth.
It's vacation time - and that means a break for US President Donald Trump.
But with Trump being one of the most vacation-happy presidents ever, critics are already gritting their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president is planning a 17-day vacation at his namesake golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's vacation began yesterday, Trump's opponents have been talking about it for weeks.
They're blaming Trump for resting too much.
In fact, it's customary for the president to spend weekends at his mansions in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days in office.
George W. Bush, for example, had already spent 67 days on vacation, while Barack Obama had spent only 21 days, half as many as Trump.
But Trump tends to forget things quickly.
Just days after taking office, Trump told "60 Minutes" that there would be no time for long vacations during his presidency because there was so much to do.
He also expressed outrage over Barack Obama's vacation three years ago.
The current president tweeted at the time, "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, partying and attending jazz concerts, ISIS is beheading journalists".
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club is not exactly relaxing.
It is officially called a working vacation, during which Trump has no time for reading or other pleasurable activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for the leave.
Specifically, the air conditioning system in the West Wing of the White House is being replaced, and as a result, all personnel have been evacuated.
The West Wing is also home to the Oval Office and other presidential offices.
"I don't think any of you want to be in the West Wing in August when it's 100 degrees and there's no air conditioning", said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president will continue to work while on vacation.
For a glimpse of where President Trump will be spending the next 17 days, watch this video.
Blocking critics on Facebook - don't run for public office if you can't take criticism from voters
The father of our country knew a thing or two about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to lambast him for everything from domestic policy to his political beliefs.
The criticism, of course, upset him.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech may be taken from us and we may be led like sheep to the slaughter".
Which brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's people have blocked and deleted at least 450 posts from his official Facebook page.
And earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him over it.
The governor's office dismissed the lawsuit, and online commentary was rife with "Who cares?" reactions.
"It's just Facebook", many said.
But it does matter.
And that counts for a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is a surprisingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
His approval rating is the second highest of the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not a knucklehead who reacts without thinking.
He's ruled this state with a firm hand and he's stayed true to his principles.
In addition, he has been quite adept at using Facebook as his primary means of communicating with his constituents, such as hilariously showing off his bald head for the first time since his chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people from visiting the governor's page - which is an officially labeled public forum run by staff paid by taxpayer dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's all too easy to paint a picture of online trolls, spammers, or hate-filled mobs.
The Post interviewed several of the real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's what they are-- real people interacting with their elected leaders-- a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not Internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not obscene at all.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan's Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Raman, a lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, wasn't advocating hate, she was advocating hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that he had not responded to hate crimes or other recent news", she wrote in a commentary for The Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people are commenting on the same thing, some people are just going to casually call it a collective effort instead of acknowledging that it's a lot of concerned citizens".
What the governor's office called a "targeted spam attack", others would probably call "public support".
The age of Facebook makes it easy to match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than it used to be, when you had to send out workers to do the same thing, to collect critical headlines and burn them, or arrest protesters and silence them.
But that's exactly what's happening now, only digitally.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for cracking down on Facebook and other social media platforms.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark rulings on the subject was handed down last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment when she blocked a voter from her Facebook page.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also visited the ACLU over its use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
Back in Washington, affordable mail had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled and anonymous correspondents lambasted his leadership.
And even then, Washington had to contend with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under such pseudonyms as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, undermining Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington Letters Project online, his office was inundated with petitions criticizing his positions on treaties of friendship, commerce, and navigation with Britain.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and debate are the cornerstones of our country.
And good leadership means embracing it.
At the Renaissance Club, Ronan Rafferty relies on the comfort of his home turf.
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty is looking forward to the comforts of home over the next three days as the East Lothian Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led last year's penultimate round at neighbouring Archerfield Links before falling to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and will act as an ambassador for the tournament in place of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and now we're going to see it shine in all its glory with this event", said Rafferty.
"The players see the course at its best, it's in glorious condition.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He is an avid supporter of the game of golf and takes great pride in what he has accomplished here.
This allows for a great presentation of the trail".
England's Eales is looking forward to defending his title for the first time, although he has won on both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling", said a Southport player.
"I was unable to defend my title at the Extremadura Open because it was taken off the calendar the year after I won.
It's magical to come back to this neighborhood.
It's a great place to play golf.
I have fond memories of last year, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that will always be in our hearts".
Returning to domestic competition is Gary Orr, who joined the Senior European Tour earlier this year when he turned 50.
This is her first event in Scotland since competing at the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"Playing at home is always a little more meaningful", said Orr, a Helensburgh man.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel the added pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again immensely and I've shown a fairly decent game of golf.
I'm happy with the way things are going so far".
Joining the trio are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior Tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in contention, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Poverty and Death in the Goldfields of Indonesia
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
He barely even uses the potty.
In a wooden cottage in Enarotali, the capital of the regency of Paniai, in Indonesia's restive Papua province, a housewife places a sweet potato, known locally as nota, directly on the fire.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed from the fire and eagerly chewed with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - he has no furniture - and does his daily household chores there, such as washing clothes in murky water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket serves as a toilet in a room without a roof.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she is not assigned to look after any field.
Polygamy is common here.
But working late can be dangerous - most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, plus there are soldiers here.
"No one dares walk around the village after five o'clock in the evening", he says.
This is a rare glimpse into life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which just 1,026 elderly people were forced to vote by raising their hands in the presence of occupying troops.
A movement calling for independence from Dutch rule quickly turned its fury against the Jakarta government, which still maintains tight control over the region, keeping out foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, leaving the eastern half of the island to the independent nation of Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate - a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to Nabire, followed by a sickening five-hour drive in a rented car.
There is no public transportation.
With a population of about 19,000, the town consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered with corrugated iron roofs that have rusted to various shades of yellowish-brown.
Very few Indonesians have made the trip, let alone journalists, and hardly any foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the BaBoos of Mee Pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing such clothes", says Degei, referring to her colorful handwoven turban, dark blouse, and bright skirt.
"Before that, we only wore leaves on our bodies".
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line and infant mortality and illiteracy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also the gold country of Indonesia.
Just 60 miles from Pania, a mountainous province roughly the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000, is Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted approximately US$3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from the mine.
In addition, Papua boasts an estimated $78 billion (U.S.) in timber.
But these riches are a source of hardship for the barefoot, since they result from the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian military.
A 2005 investigation by The New York Times revealed that Freeport paid approximately US$20 million to local soldiers and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to US$150,000 per officer.
The baboons' quest for greater autonomy threatens this golden goose and they are treated ruthlessly.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings of Papuan hill tribes in the 1970's amounted to genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
The 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Birsbane, 'We are losing everything', includes testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (with rape and electrocution particularly common, according to another report), and the brutal suppression of peaceful protests.
"The number of victims is difficult to estimate because these incidents happen every week", says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened further as Papua's natural resources have led to an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Eighty-three percent of the province's 3.5 million people are Christian, but the demographics are changing with the arrival of Muslim economic migrants from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
In Javanese family restaurants, gado-gado is served with crispy chicken and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"The migrants started selling chicken and vegetables at the traditional market at cheaper prices than the local farmers", explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to the provincial capital, Jayapura, to work.
"As a result, the indigenous Papuan - the Papuan mama-mama [women] - are losing their market share".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter won 27 of Papua's 29 constituencies, including Paniai, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and the local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice", says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a recession just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children were singing Christmas carols around a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle emerged from the darkness.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the headlights.
According to a local pastor, Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers took offense at their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers chased children and beat them with the butts of their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers fired among the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated even further.
Some 1,000 young Papuan men, women, and children gathered on the soccer field in front of the local police station and military headquarters to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance of the Papuan mee pago tribe, which involved running around and imitating the songs of birds.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and soldiers.
"If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them", said an official document seen by TIME magazine but not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, a 56-year-old elder of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, sensed an imminent threat and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one was willing to listen.
"As I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist", he told TIME magazine from the brightly colored porch of his tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, a lot of gunfire", he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was shot three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to her and examined her body to make sure it was her", Yohanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME gloomily.
"I saw that he was dead... and I kissed him".
Papua police inspector-general Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were merely ensuring the safety of their station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when we are threatened with death", said Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
News of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made an impassioned speech in Jayapura, offering condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address abuses in Papua.
"I want to solve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future", he said.
According to the Office of the SRSG on Children and Armed Conflict, he was responsible for recruitment and use of children in Ituri from 2002 to 2003.
But almost immediately, there were apologies.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of these took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes", he said.
However, speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto backtracked, saying that he had no intention of establishing a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said that "everything will be settled according to the law".
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of human rights crimes in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the bloody 1999 independence referendum, said 11 human rights crimes had already been solved in Papua, including the one in Paniai.
The families of Paniai's victims greeted such claims with grim disbelief.
"I have been interrogated four times in the past three years, but there has been no progress", said Yohanes.
"I'm tired now".
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared", he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid they'll shoot me".
His brother, Yacobus, confirmed that the people of Paniai were afraid to examine the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came looking for me", he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police opened fire on villagers in Paniai's neighboring regency of Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when villagers negotiated with a construction company manager who refused to transport an unconscious man to a hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died en route to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, villagers threw stones at the police, who responded with warning shots.
But according to locals, the mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) opened fire on the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a state of panic, afraid of reprisals", said Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought in.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days".
Deiyai's parliament has demanded that the police officers involved be held accountable and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a trouble spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is fueling discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damali tribes of Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (FPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papuans by occasionally carrying out attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the LRA are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in Paniai in recent years under the pretext of 'defending state sovereignty'.
Some of them never show up again.
Among the Papuan people, Paniai is known as "the tragic forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
What little rice is sold in Enarotari is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as inaccessible.
People grow all their own food -- mostly sweet potatoes, a little bit of fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can tend four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for their families and sell the rest at the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes are only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
According to the information provided by the Lebanese authorities, the number of Lebanese daily newspapers has been steadily decreasing over the past years.
The few jobs that do exist go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
The Papuans themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying because there are no jobs and no money", says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Seclusion keeps the world's eyes off Papa.
In addition, strict restrictions on foreign media remain in place.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua for "failing to observe proper practices", even though they had been granted a rare filming permit.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election promises to remove restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"Journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's easternmost restive provinces of Papua and West Papua face new threats of visa denial and blacklisting", he said in a statement.
The lack of press scrutiny means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of crimes" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also historically supported the GDR.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic order and a free press, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of human rights violations".
People here want more attention from foreign governments.
When an official Dutch delegation headed by the country's human rights ambassador, Kees Van Baari, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence, according to a source who attended the meeting but requested anonymity, urging, "We want freedom".
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but leftists don't think they'll vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting", says Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to understand that in addition to the constant threat of a predatory military, the people of Paniai suffer from poor education and health services.
According to Gobai, the Paniai people, like other Papuan people, view their vote for Jokowi as a debt that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they want justice", he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting managed one last symbolic act of defiance - burying the body of one of the victims in a field opposite the police station and military base.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed", says Yacobus, his head bowed.
"What else can we do?"
A fire has engulfed the Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time.
A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
This is the second fire in just two years to ravage the skyscraper, known casually as the Torch.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no immediate cause of the fire was given.
"We slept and were awakened by a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor", a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
According to Dubai Civil Defence officials, firefighters extinguished the blaze at around 4 am local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may again raise questions worldwide about the safety of materials used on the exterior of high-rise buildings.
The investigation carried out by the Board of Directors of Torch after the fire in 2015 found that the facades - the decorative panels and insulation of the exterior - suffered the most damage.
British police have said that they believe the insulation and cladding of London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that killed some 80 people there in June.
Look, these phones are probably gonna be the hottest sellers this fall.
Spring and autumn are a golden time for technology enthusiasts as phone manufacturers unveil their new flagship models.
With the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium in the spring, consumers can look forward to more hit phones in the fall.
According to Kristjan Seema, Marketing and Sales Director at Tele2, this year's flagships are characterised by innovative design, an iris scanner, an edge-to-edge 4K resolution screen and a super-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the top of the Estonian smartphone sales chart, has caused great excitement in the technology world.
Coming in the fall, it promises even faster, faster charging, a longer-lasting battery, a better camera, and better water and dust resistance.
He added that based on the rumors, it is already possible to make predictions and predict the top four models that are likely to dominate the sales charts this year.
These four top-of-the-line smartphones will be available in stores later this fall.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to hit stores in mid-September.
Rumors abound as to what the new Apple model will look like and what it can do.
If the iPhone 7 did not bring significantly large differences next to the iPhone 6s, then for Apple's tenth birthday, the new model is expected to be completely different from its predecessors.
Four colors are mentioned: black, white, rose gold, and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is apparently a screen that covers the entire front of the phone, the home button is missing and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple design chief Jony Ive insists that the new iPhone model look like smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to an iris scanner, wireless charging and an even better camera, you can expect a faster A11 processor.
It's definitely one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-orders for the all-new Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23.
There's been a lot of speculation about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It's rumored to be aimed even more at the business user, and the S Pen allows for even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle lens and the other with a telephoto lens with a narrower field of view.
No one yet knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first attempt at something that is certainly comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
But we are eagerly awaiting August 23.
Although Nokia has shipped three smartphones this year, led by the Nokia 6, it is still missing its flagship, the Nokia 8, which will be unveiled on August 16.
What we expect from Nokia is a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display and a super-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminium body and a remarkable IP68 water and dust resistance rating.
Like Samsung, the new Nokia model has two rear cameras with optics made by Zeiss.
While Sony's solid flagship has been the XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We're expecting a smartphone that's a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but with at least as good or better cameras.
Sony's new model has been speculated to have a screen of at least six inches.
We will soon see what the reality holds, as Sony has traditionally unveiled its fall flagship at the IFA international technology fair, which this year runs from September 1-6.
According to leaked phone transcripts, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for his border wall.
The Washington Post published transcripts of telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump called Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and urged him to stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for his proposed border wall.
The president of the United States confronted him about his public condemnation, saying, "You can't say that to the press".
Trump based his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement for the United States to take in refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous", "grotesque" and "stupid". He claimed that the deal, made during the Obama administration, made him look "stupid" for proposing a ban on refugee resettlement in the United States.
Trump ended the speech by telling Turnbull that it was "the most unpleasant speech of the day".
The Supreme Court did not hear the appeal of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their bid for the procurement of bus transport from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a directive rejecting OÜ MRP Linna Liinid's bid for the Tartu bus station because the bid did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, head of the Tartu City Government Rights Service.
This is a procurement for public bus transport within the city of Tartu for the period from 01.07.2019 to 30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Liinid appealed the decision of the Tartu District Court to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
While many on social media are complaining that the noise from Weekend Festival is disturbing their sleep and that the city is full of drunken revelers, there are many who have nothing bad to say about the beach festival.
In fact, I'm positively surprised the party people at the store were so polite!
I didn't see any blurriness or rudeness.
I even saw kindness", says a spider named Laine.
"It's nice to come and enjoy Pärnu, which has remained like a winter dream", he adds cheerfully.
The murky waves from the beach don't disturb your sleep.
While living in the city center, he could still hear music playing on the beach, but now the music had not yet reached his home.
"But I hope to hear", he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who also spoke with Õhtuleht, says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu - it helps the local merchants' turnover.
He is also pleased that so many foreigners have visited the summer capital.
The noise of a party doesn't bother a woman.
Even though I don't sunbathe on the beach anymore, it's nice to see the beach come alive.
And it's great that people are moving, and it's happened three times already", she says.
I think it was a little worse the first time.
"Maybe there were complaints", he thinks.
However, he says that noise on the beach is common among summer residents.
"This weekend is a very good promo for our small town", says Harri, who is staying in the park.
The noise and commotion haven't affected his rhythm of life either.
But why?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interracial interaction could be better.
Loud music won't break a man.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live nearby.
"Good people can stick together and there's no trouble", he says.
He says the guests at the mansion are polite.
"They've gone a bit overboard with the bottles, of course", he says, "but the kids are young, and by God, go ahead and be human, and we'll do it!"
People living along the coast will have traveled far to be with relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of noise", says Tiina, who is walking with her children in Pärnu.
Even his family's sleep is not disturbed by the festival music, although last year it was heard even further away than this year.
Last summer, the stage was the other way, so we heard more.
We live outside the city, so it actually resonates quite well far away by the Pärnu river", he says.
Pearson is cutting another 3,000 jobs and slashing its dividend to revive the business.
British education company Pearson said Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its dividend by 72 percent, launching another restructuring program to address a looming business crisis.
On the basis of the above, the Commission concludes that the restructuring plan will restore the long-term viability of the Bank.
Pearson announced plans in May to cut another £300 million (US$394 million) in costs as part of a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive the business, which has been hit by the rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which agreed last month to sell a stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, said its expectations for the year were unchanged after reporting a 1% rise in sales to £2.05bn in the first half.
On Sunday, the hot summer weather will continue with showers.
In Estonia, there will be hot summer weather with a chance of thunderstorms on Sunday, with wind gusts sometimes very strong.
There will be clouds and clear skies in Estonia tonight.
Showers in many areas, possible thunderstorms.
Winds out of the southwest and west at 5 to 11 knots, gusts up to 14 knots, islands and coastal areas up to 18 knots.
The air temperature is between 13 and 17 degrees.
It's going to be partly cloudy today.
Showers in many areas, possible thunderstorms.
South-westerly wind 6 to 12, gusts up to 15, islands and coast up to 20 m/s.
The air temperature is between 18 and 21 degrees.
Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed by suicide bomber
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabaghi district of the city.
The bombing is the latest in a spate of violence to hit Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in an attack on a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by "a man carrying a homemade explosive device".
The statement said all the wounded are in stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) in Karabakh is a serious concern for NATO forces at Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shia neighbourhood of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On 31 May, a major bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people - the deadliest military attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump considers whether to increase the number of U.S. troops assisting the country's military and police.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reversed its decision to delay the injunction after lawsuits.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era regulation requiring states to limit smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision to proceed with "2015 ozone assessment activities" late Wednesday, saying it shows the agency's commitment to working with the states.
"We believe we need to engage and listen to our state partners", EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to delay the ozone assessment - which measures smog in different parts of the country to determine where levels should be reduced to meet stricter air quality standards - by one year to October 2018.
Fifteen mostly Democratic states joined the District of Columbia in filing a lawsuit Tuesday saying the decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has attempted to roll back many of the environmental regulations put in place by former President Barack Obama as part of what Trump says is a broader plan to spur economic growth.
But these efforts have provoked a backlash from democrats and environmental groups concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
According to the EPA Web site, breathing ozone-contaminated air "can impair lung function and increase the risk of respiratory illnesses", such as asthma.
German pigs can have a feast.
Germany's pigs and cattle may be in for a treat as heavy rains threaten the harvest of the European Union's second-largest wheat producer, reports Bloomberg.
This year, weeks of heavy downpours before the harvest may mean that the breadfruit crop will be used only to feed livestock.
"The quality of the wheat is far worse than last year and worse than 2015", said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of Germany's wheat crop could be used for animal feed, twice as much as usual, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First of all, the winter was too dry.
Then came a cold spring, followed by a heat wave in June.
In July rainstorms hit Germany and have continued into August.
Many eyes are on northern Germany, where rain is hampering the harvest.
So far, only 5 percent of the wheat crop has been harvested.
In most areas, the harvest has not even begun, according to Ceravis, a local collector.
"These are quite difficult days", said Frank Deckert, a senior trader at Ceravis in Rendsburg.
Harmony in All Things - Finnish Interior Design Tricks
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the trade fair houses, as many of the (living) rooms have magnificent views of the banks of the Saimaa through the large windows.
Every step reveals our northern neighbours' desire to create homes that are both cool and perfect (energy efficient).
The Finns' skill in using wood as a building and finishing material, as well as in making furniture and decorative items, is both admired and imitated.
Both the builder and the (home) designer will find stimulating ideas and clever solutions in the trade fair buildings.
It clearly shows that combinations of shades of black, white, and gray, when complemented by wood tones and houseplants, can be very atmospheric.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, because the fair lasts until August 13.
The utensils and herb pots suggest that this kitchen was used frequently for cooking.
Last night marked the end of this year's Weekend Festival Balticule, and Martin Garrix gave his all on the main stage to be the last performer to be remembered.
The crowd was really going crazy during Garrix's performance - singing, hula-hooping, dancing selflessly.
When Garrix finished, they were poured as one mass from Pärnu beach to the city.
We're bringing you a gallery of all the images our photographer captured over a three-day weekend.
I'm sure you're one of them. Find yourself.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face each other in the most exciting boxing match of the near future in the up to 140-pound weight class, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles when Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked across the hall to greet Lomachenko, the featherweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's unanimous decision victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are in the top five.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
I wish you luck".
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Maria on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "the perfect measure".
"I'm a former featherweight", Garcia recalled.
"I moved up for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140 pounds.
I want to move down to the lightweight division.
And he has to move up to lightweight, and then we can fight.
It's what the fans want.
Let's give them that".
Lomachenko has agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight".
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be a pay-per-view event as part of his strategy to have Lomachenko make his debut in the 61.2-kg class later this year in order to make it possible for him to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 KOs) next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their lightweight title bout on September 23 at the Forum.
"This fight could be worth watching because the fans have been asking for this fight", Garcia said, later saying that he was open to the fight on whatever channel offered the best financial package.
"We are the main actors.
No other name commands so much attention.
Whenever they're ready"...
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko is a "great fighter" and might go to his fight on Saturday.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in his praise of Garcia, saying that he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted that knockout".
Garcia said the idea was to show off the punching power and then box.
They both confirmed that they feel the tension building between them.
"This is a struggle waiting to happen.
No other confrontation generates this much attention and buzz.
I'm more than willing to work for it", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is it.
It's going to be a good fight".
From what parts of the world do people move to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record number of over 13 000 residence permits to third-country nationals, most of whom travelled to Estonia to work, study or visit family.
For example, while last year 6702 foreigners were granted temporary residence permits, the figure was 4928 the year before.
Officials cannot say how many immigrants will eventually stay in Estonia permanently, but the Ministry of the Interior is preparing such an analysis.
While ten years ago about 500 Ukrainians a year moved to Estonia, in recent years the number has been approaching 2,000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased sharply during the Ukrainian crisis - 1087 people were granted temporary residence permits in 2014, compared to 675 a year earlier.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is growing the most - 850 more Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia last year than left.
"The Ukrainian community in Estonia has always been large, and because of the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural for people to look for work and study opportunities in a country where the community and, for many, family already come first", said Interior Ministry spokeswoman Kristin Rammus.
Last year and the year before, the number of Ukrainians granted temporary residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although the latter have been granted the highest number of temporary residence permits in ten years.
If Ukrainians come here mainly for work, Russian citizens for family migration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the strongest family ties to people living in Russia", said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the National Defense Academy.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have received Estonian residence permits have moved to, Harju County is right behind Ida-Virumaa", he added, pointing out that about 40 percent of them are married to citizens of the European Union.
Last year, 1,696 Russian citizens were granted temporary residence permits, also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians applying to renew their residence permits actually decreased.
"The jump is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanently settling in Estonia", explained Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, who said that Russian citizens' interest in the Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived in Estonia for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit to settle permanently in Estonia from the previous year.
The aim is to encourage people who have adapted to stay.
However, a residence permit for a long-term resident requires, for example, five years.
Due to the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased.
For example, last year 146 Ukrainians who had worked here for at least three years were granted such residence permits.
Now Ukrainians can change jobs and the Estonian state no longer cares whether the salary criterion is met.
This residence permit has become increasingly popular, with gray passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36) among the applicants last year.
Altogether, 1,968 people received residence permits to settle in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians, and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants has already reached 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
In 2007, three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, compared with 200 last year.
Nigerians come here to study at the universities.
Estonian universities are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens from India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely due to educational mobility.
For them, too, the rule is that where there is a community, it is easier for others to join", added Rammus.
Over the past ten years, two people have moved to Estonia from North Korea, and the same number from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If around 6000 third-country nationals are granted a residence permit each year, this represents around 0,46% of the total population.
Even when EU citizens are included, migration remains at around one per cent", Maasing commented that the figures were actually low.
According to Statistics Estonia, a total of 14,822 people moved to Estonia last year, while 13,792 left the country.
This means that immigration exceeded emigration in the second year.
Most of the emigrants and immigrants are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among the emigrants.
As a result, the net migration of Estonian citizens was negative by 2,000 people last year.
Estonians migrate mainly between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture princess fashion is all about lace, embroidery and tulle.
For Maria Tammeoru, however, there is history - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours in a museum and admire old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
When you're passionate about something, you explore and learn more about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem alien to some, but not to the designer.
You decide how much sparkle you want in your life!
I have a friend who has a sauna full of haute couture dresses I designed.
Because it's not her fault that she doesn't live in Hollywood and walk the red carpet every day, she wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and she does!
You get to live your own special life!
A fashion designer doesn't recognize the gap between glamorous events and drab everyday life.
It was this way of thinking that made the plan to bring high fashion to the Estonian countryside, between forests and fields, to people who are often not reached by fashion.
Mammu's collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu, where a royal fashion show with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, people often pose and nod with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - they shout bravo, they stand up, they want to shake your hand.
A lot of people in the audience were just curious, but now they're Mammu Couture fans.
When you exceed people's expectations, they're thrilled!
And I like to feel like I'm on a summer tour with my fashion line.
In Pärnu we had a 50-meter-long red carpet, the whole street was full of beautiful dresses, it seemed that they would never end!
Maria also doesn't accept the fashionable notion that a creation must be presented to a superstar by a supermodel, she likes to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients on stage - they have always been happy to come.
It's such a cool experience, you get to shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry I never got to see my own show because I'm always behind the scenes, trying to put the finishing touches on things like a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves won't allow me to watch from the gallery.
Maria is the kind of designer who doesn't just want to be a model. She wants to be involved.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio. I do most of my own sewing.
I love the whole process of you playing with the details, discovering.
I'm never far from my work, and I'm not afraid to work.
It's not just the design, it's the styling, the logistics, the planning, the organization, it all has to fit into one day for one temperamental woman.
I'm sure these fanatics have a lot of work to do.
I can't tell you when my work day is over. For me, it's just a day full of joy.
I'm still very lucky - it's like a never-ending chain of luck: I do something nice, the person gets something nice, and they compliment me.
How many times have I been told that my dresses have magic, that they make you feel like a princess?
The richly embroidered satchels that made Maria's talent famous overnight remain the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Müürsepp of the U18 boys: The Estonian subgroup tournament weapon was now turned against us
It's too bad the fairy tale ended.
The first thing I noticed was that we couldn't get our table.
And when there is such a big difference in the table, there is nothing to do", commented our only NBA player, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Müürsepp, on the Estonian U18 basketball team's 61-75 loss to Great Britain.
The opponents took 28 balls off the board and got so many more attacks because of it.
We weren't prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, either.
Many of the English attacks were over in three to five seconds. We couldn't mount a defense.
Defensively, they had their hands in everything. We couldn't combine.
It let the team down.
Our opponents' homework was better.
According to Müürsepa, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes to slow down the opponents.
It's the fourth quarter, and we're 0-for-4, and they've already made some quick shots.
The athleticism and tightness that were our weapons in the subgroup tournament were now turned against us.
Today we were powerless against their aggression.
The bricklayer was content with his ward in Kalevi, Matthias Tas.
In the tournament in general, you can say good things about the whole team, until today they were a unified batting team.
It's a pity you've never faced such an aggressive opponent before.
Tass has always been confident and played his part today, but he seemed tired - he's been carrying quite a load.
But he did some pretty cool moves I've seen in training before", the instructor added.
Terrible numbers: the girls' basketball team scored less than 10 points in three quarters at the European Championships...
The U18 basketball tournament in Tallinn is not just for boys. The girls started yesterday in Dublin.
And Estonia's game against Poland was unfortunately anti-record.
Estonia lost 25-65, but even after the third quarter, the score was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took their foot off the gas pedal and that period was tied at 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4, 1 point in the third...
In the first two minutes, the Estonians hit two of the first four shots, but then they missed 25 shots, then one three, and then another 21 shots...
Maybe in almost half an hour, one of the 47 shots hit.
And two points from four free throws.
Ball losses were a reasonable number at the time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had shot 33 percent and Estonia 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two defeats, opening day had to admit Portugal's 83:56 advantage.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to resupply
Today, NATO's 1st Minesweeping Flotilla arrived in Tallinn for a planned weekend port visit to resupply ships and prepare for upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the vessels make preparations to return to sea, giving the crew the opportunity to rest for a few days.
Following the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to conduct a number of exercises and prepare for future historic mine-hunting operations.
'The Estonians' participation in the NATO unit and the joint training they are carrying out in local waters are a good example of our integration with the allied forces,' said Commander of the Operations and Planning Division of the Estonian Navy, acting Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet, Major General Arto Reinmaa.
As of 29 June, NATO's 1st Standing Mine Countermeasures Group is commanded by Lieutenant Commander Gvido Laudups of the Latvian Navy, who took over the duties of Group Commander from Lieutenant Commander Johan-Elias Seljama of the Estonian Navy at a ceremony held in Riga.
The Latvian Navy support vessel LVNS Virsaitis has been designated as the flagship of the group and also operates the group's command post.
The minehunter Sakala of the Estonian Navy will also be part of the international unit this semester.
As one of four groups of ships under the command of NATO Maritime Command, Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 1 is a rapid-response first responder readiness unit that the Alliance can deploy anywhere in the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita Monastery will once again become the venue for the Birgitta Festival, initiated 13 years ago by maestro Eri Klasi.
According to the artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic, Risto Joost (36), this year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: "Traviata" and "Tosca", classics of the opera world, ballet productions from the enchanting "Bolero" to the fun "Karlsson" will reach the audience, and there will also be an in-house production, this time of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorio "The Seasons" by the same international creative team that brought Haydn's other masterpiece "The Creation" to the Pirita stage in 2015.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It's bigger than any musical theater in its traditional form.
It's a festival whose spell takes hold and never quite lets go.
Because the experience that the listener gets in this lofty and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touches human minds in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, this is your first year as artistic director of the Birgitta Festival.
Didn't Maestro's Special Class shoes seem a little big when he was growing up?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Special Klass, it's been very helpful.
He guided me through my entire student career and supported me in my early career as a conductor.
Maybe that's what makes it easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the team of the Birgitta Festival and of course it will all rub off on me.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things work.
It was Eri Klasi's big heart that gave me the strength to continue with the Tallinn Philharmonic's Birgitta Festival.
And now I'm here, and I can do this!
What could possibly excite the audience at this year's festival that you offer that's so special?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and as a surprise the first ballet based on a story by Astrid Lindgren will be presented in the museum.
That's what "Karlsson flies" is for.
And one curious nuance is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed the desire to write this work.
He's probably had Karlsson's personality since he was a kid.
Risto, how are you holding up?
Thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
This kind of work requires a support system and a lot of love, and luckily, I have plenty of that.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend so much on other people as they do on me, on how I approach each new day.
And this kind of consciously staying in tone, staying positive, and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, significantly increased my happiness percentage.
Especially now, this week, when we have the most important rehearsals, I've been practicing really hard, and it's working.
Smiling to yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a figure of speech.
I don't think people know half the things about their bodies that the universe has to offer, but I guess we'll just have to figure it out for ourselves.
Now, now, this is the big moment.
Do you have a ritual before you take the conductor's chair?
Yes, I do. I need to change into something more comfortable.
It's that little moment for yourself.
But in general, yeah, I don't get a chance to relax or take a nap before the big show.
In fact, I like to interact with people actively, even before stepping onto the conductor's stand.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, there's something to discover even for the not so great lover of opera and ballet!

New results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers published
In Sweden a test was administered to asylum seekers in which their age was assessed using a novel medical approach, and the latest results show that more than 80 percent of those tested were judged to be over 18, although not all believe the results to be accurate.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began tests earlier this year.
The tests were designed to provide a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several allegedly underage refugees.
The Migration Agency has so far sent 6,880 cases for testing and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2,481 test results between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were estimated to be 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the Institute of Forensic Medicine estimated that the test subject "may be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person was 'likely to be under 18'.
Tests are only used when the age of the person is in question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"We don't see a big difference compared to the statistics of previous months, the numbers are quite consistent", he told The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as being over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lied about their age.
The institute released the results of 581 tests in May and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the subject is 18 years of age or older".
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of these 581 tests, it was found that in 243 cases the person had directly stated that he or she would turn 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, which involves taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of the knee joints and then having them analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some circles.
One skeptic is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves evaluating people's biological maturity to determine whether they went through puberty earlier or later than normal.
'I have had reason to think about it and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
Determining biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can", he told the Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally speaking, the risk of incorrectly categorizing a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk, about 10 percent, occurs when a person is just under 18".

Twenty-year-old javelin thrower Anna Maria Orel made a fine debut at the World Championships in London, finishing a strong 18th with a time of 67.37.
Orel was the youngest female hammer thrower at the World Championships and the cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
With the first attempt (64.80) I immediately made my average result, with the second (62.80) I risked too much and with the third (67.37) I managed to keep my head clear", said Orel after the race.
I was looking for my release, and I'm very glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's World Championship debut ended with a solid 18th place.
The rains didn't bother Orel because he's training through the winter at TTU Stadium.
"I've been tempered", he said with a small grunt.
With the London Olympic Stadium packed to capacity, was the Eagle aware of the people around it, or was it able to turn itself off?
I get it, but in a good way.
Everybody says it adds up - it does!
When you compete, you get to experience it.
Orel confirmed that he was satisfied with his World Championship debut and that he still had many good races ahead of him: "I came here with the 32nd or last result of this season, finishing 18th.
That's a very decent score.
I'm 20 years old and at the World Cup, that's all that matters.
I'm going to take a lot of experience with me, and someday I want to compete for medals.
The governor of West Virginia has announced a change of party.
West Virginia Governor Jim Justice, a Democrat, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he is switching parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats walked out on me", said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, after much prayer and reflection... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia, that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor".
The assembly erupted in cheers.
"That makes me a Republican tomorrow", Justice added.
"As your coach, I'm telling you it's time to play another game".
Trump had earlier promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the state's only billionaire according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from his father.
He's worth approximately $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement Thursday night saying that "Gov. Justice's party shift is another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather prevent than work to make this country great again".
"With only 15 governorships and control of the lowest number of states in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rebuke to a party that is completely out of control and unable to find a positive and unifying message", RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
I guess it's no surprise that where there's a lot of people, there's a lot of injuries.
Urmet, who was in charge of the medical tent over the weekend, told Õhtulehte yesterday that they have had to hand out quite a lot of patches.
Blisters and abrasions are basic, sprains and minor falls.
And, of course, the headaches, the backaches, the leg aches.
Urmet says people come to the festival with the wrong shoes and that's when the problems start.
Paramedics have also had to treat some seriously injured visitors - there have been a few panic attacks and a broken leg.
We've also done stitches when a person has broken an arm or a finger.
We'll do the smaller stitches here, send the larger ones to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if the partygoers ask the doctors for a hangover cure.
Coe praised the Russians' sincere apology for the doping scandal.
International figure skater Sebastian Coe praised what he said was "Russia's sincere apology on Thursday" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now was not the time to allow the country back into the sport.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Championships that the ban on his country was justified and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized "to all the athletes who have had their gold and silver medals taken away from them".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today was a very honest answer, a very honest presentation", IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian federation itself admitted that they have had rather difficult times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the federation".
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia had accepted the criteria for its restoration.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendation that now is not the time to pull Russia back", Coe said.
"We must do everything possible in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system", he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the IAAF's strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said Monday that Russia does not yet meet several criteria for reinstatement.
Following his presentation to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping controls were still inadequate and that banned coaches were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution is fundamentally changing the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution fundamentally change everything from fuel markets to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metals market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say they're winning in one place and losing in another, it doesn't help smaller mining companies.
Today, Glencore makes its money from coal and oil, but in the future, in the age of electric cars, there will be a growing demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel.
This year, the stakes for the spread of electric cars have been raised by the decisions of the UK, French and Norwegian governments to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
Therefore, Volvo has already announced that they plan to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will launch a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that within two decades, more electric cars will be sold than cars using fossil fuels.
"For some metals, this is a game changer", Simona Gambranini, a commodities analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We've already seen a big impact on metals like cobalt and lithium, which have been in high demand for years.
Electric cars contain about three times as much copper as conventional cars, Glencore said.
Even more copper will be needed at loading stations, which Exane BNP Paribas estimates will increase copper demand by around 5% by 2025.
The increase in demand for batteries for electric cars means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from the upward trend in electric cars, from higher copper prices and from being the world's largest cobalt producer, Jefferies Group predicted.
According to this brokerage firm, the other winners in the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already reacting to the changing trend.
The price of cobalt on the London Metal Exchange has risen 70 percent this year.
Last year's price increase was 37 percent.
Copper has also risen 14 percent this year, largely because of economic growth.
Glencore's stock jumped 20 percent in London after outperforming rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losing side are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine, which have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of lead is in the batteries that power petrol and diesel car starters.
Electric cars are powered by lithium ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to steel demand unless it can be repurposed to overcome the drop in demand", said Michael Widmer, head of metals research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The impact of the free-rolling trend is not yet visible in the form of lead price movements.
Lead has risen 17 percent this year, making it the best performing major industrial metal in London.
Investors see problems for the metal far in the future.
"I'm not sure lead is so bad, because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competitive", said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager for Triland Metals, a metals brokerage.
When demand for lead falls, it does so slowly.
Maybe it'll happen like this in about ten years.
In the meantime, stricter emissions standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, which rely on advanced lead-acid batteries for frequent engine starts, will increase, estimates the International Lead and Zinc Research Organization.
Lightweight metals like aluminum are replacing steel because a lighter car can go further with less electricity.
This explains the additional aluminium demand of 1,6 million tonnes already between 2013 and 2016.
This represents 2,7% of the world's total aluminium production.
This trend is likely to intensify, Widmer said.
Aluminum has risen 13 percent this year as increased demand from automakers has led to a shortage in the market.
The steelmakers never sleep.
AK Steel Holdings is teaming up with General Motors to use nanotechnology to make wonderfully lightweight car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter steel alloy to withstand the aluminium minimum.
'Super alloy steel should be the answer to this development,' said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
Some progress has been made in Europe.
The end of the age of oil may also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was used in catalytic converters for diesel-powered cars, according to Johnson Matthey, a metal refiner.
"Many commodities that are currently in high demand, such as oil and platinum, may not be in high demand in the future", said Bernard Dahdah, a commodities analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Plate makers believe there will be continued demand for diesel hybrids.
Uncore CEO Marc Grynberg said that hybrid cars will continue to outsell pure electric cars in 2025.
Plate makers' big hope for the next 10 years are hydrogen-powered cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motors, which rely on platinum to generate electricity from hydrogen.
However, the technology has not yet been commercially viable.
"Diesel seems to be the clear loser on the road to electric cars", said Exane BNP Paribas Brunet.
German carmakers suffered a major setback in July when a court in Stuttgart banned the use of diesel in the home city of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unbridled spending by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences from UEFA, the governing body that governs the European game and has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain still has a long way to go.
The financial fair play (FFP) rules established by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to the French club.
PSG can certainly afford to spend that kind of money to sign Neymar and add him to their star-studded squad, given that the team is funded by Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
The Commission considers that the transfer of the 1998 implementation agreement to Real Madrid constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
FFP was initiated by Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that go into huge debt in search of success were actually cheating and risked bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In addition, the Commission observes that the transfer pricing report does not take into account the fact that the transfer pricing arrangement endorsed by the contested tax ruling endorses a transfer pricing arrangement that departs from a reliable approximation of a market-based outcome.
This change means that the business model first used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then spending heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
The Commission considers that the measure in question constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
And despite Platini's ignominious ouster from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to curbing overspending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly continue to strengthen these rules in the future", Andrea Traverso, UEFA's FFP supervisor, told The Associated Press last week.
According to Article 107 (1) TFEU, 'any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the internal market'.
However, the Commission notes that the transfer of the 1998 implementation agreement to FC Den Bosch does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG received the heaviest penalties, along with Abu Dhabi's Manchester City.
PSG were fined €60 million ($82 million at the time), later reduced to €20 million, and were required to limit their Champions League squad for the 2014-15 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may try to outmaneuver the financial regulators by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the club owners.
While a Qatari company may sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship is considered to be above standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income.
The Commission notes that, in its opening decision, the Commission expressed doubts as to the compatibility of the measures with the internal market, in particular as regards their compatibility with the internal market under Article 107 (3) (c) TFEU.
There have been rumours that a certain portion of Neymar's PSG salary may come from payments by the 2022 World Cup organising committee in Qatar.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a World Cup ambassador, claiming that UEFA regulators could easily detect such a maneuver.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant against any attempt to circumvent the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed Neymar's transfer with PSG beforehand.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
On the basis of the above, the Commission concludes that the measures under assessment constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a positive impact on sponsorship, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase in turnover of at least 30% in connection with the conclusion of the agreement.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of its biggest stars, tried to block Neymar's transfer, claiming that PSG was in breach of FFP.
"This is a clear case of financial doping by club and country", La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG's majority Qatari ownership.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports magnate, shares La Liga's view that the state is funding the club.
"This is a consequence of ownership rights and it has completely changed the whole football landscape in the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
"When a country owns a club, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial fair play rules because the country may have other ways or other interests for such a big player to represent the country.'
Norwegian, the Norwegian low-cost airline, has a nice tradition of putting pictures of those who have pushed the boundaries in their field and have been an inspiration to others on the nose of the aircraft, writes trip.ee
As the geographical scope of Norwegian operations has expanded, so has the pool of people who have earned a place on the airline's flight deck.
Among those selected are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (pictured), and Miguel de Cervantes, to name a few.
Soon, however, one plane will be adorned with a portrait of Queen's legendary singer Freddie Mercury.
50 years ago today, a hurricane-force storm in Estonia ripped off roofs and windows.
The hurricane, dubbed the storm of the century, which struck on 6 and 7 August, caused extensive damage mainly in Lääne County, Harju County and Rapland County.
In north-western Estonia, wind speeds of over 30 m/s were recorded during these days.
My old man would run from one crooked tree to another in the garden and try to support them with his hands.
It was all dark and gritty, like the end of the world.
In 2002, Linda Kurova, an elderly woman in Haapsalu, recalled in an interview with the Estonian magazine Eesti Loodus that roofs were already flying off the houses on the island.
Linda's husband saw his garden collapse.
But what are you doing with your hands up in the trees, where you can withstand a storm like this?
The sea came in through the window, water splashed in through the windows", said Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalus.
It was not until the next morning that Linda, like most of the mourners, saw that the road was lined with trees and that the roof of the railway station had been blown away some 70 or 80 feet [20-30 m].
According to the locals, behind Paralepa, the trees were all down, some completely down, some in half.
It all looked very depressing, the storm raging through the beautiful old trees like a war.
Compared to western Estonia, Lääne-Virumaa did not suffer particularly badly in the August storm of 1967, but the damage there was also great, wrote Virumaa Teataja in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped out, but the parks in our area were also badly affected.
In Tallinn winds were measured at up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
On the evening of August 6, a little girl had cried out: "Mommy, mommy!
The chickens are in the air and can't get down!"
Põlli Manor, located in a fertile field, was so badly damaged during the storm that it was later demolished.
The structures of the Türi ski jumping hill did not withstand the August storm and were later not restored.
The newspaper Red Star of August 12, 1967, said that the clearing of towns and villages of fallen trees and their branches was progressing slowly, and residents could help with the cleanup.
Crops were also badly damaged in the storm, and the newspaper reported that "the party's grassroots organizations must be the inspiration and guide for both the cleanup and the harvest".
A hurricane is when the average wind speed exceeds 100 miles per hour [32.7 m/s].
The wind speed record in Estonia was set on 2 November 1969, when the wind speed at Ruhnu was measured at 48 m/s.
On the island of Vaindloo, a gauge broke, making it impossible to record accurately the strong winds recorded there.
The secret to clean beaches: night cleaning and bad weather
Cooler summers also mean less cleaning work on Tallinn's bathing beaches.
"When the weather is good, there are people on the beach, and when it is bad, there are no people", says a beach cleaner.
Seagulls are howling on the banks of the North Tallinn Stream.
Their melodic competition is a low-revving tractor plowing stripes on the beach.
In fact, it sifts through two inches [7 cm] of sand, picking up marine debris and human waste - bottle caps, cigarette butts, and the like.
People still come to the beach whether the water's warm or not.
When the weather is fine, people are on the beach, and when it is not fine, people are not on the beach", says Aleksandr Usov, manager of beach cleaning for the nonprofit association Haabersti Haldus.
It is 6:30 a.m., and the beach is being swept clean because by 8:00 a.m., the area must be ready for people.
Usov's been at his post since 4:00.
In addition to Stroom, he also keeps an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Paljasaari's Pikakari beach.
The amount of garbage has decreased.
Years ago, it was a lot more.
People now appreciate what is being done for them", says Usov, who has been cleaning beaches for 15 years.
It used to be that when you put something new up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're keeping what's on the beach.
The Cost of a Clean Beach
One of the biggest jobs on Estonian beaches is cleaning up marine debris.
In Pirita, for example, 400,000 tonnes have to be transported during the beach season.
"This is an incredible amount", Usov notes.
The second major category is household garbage, or what people leave behind.
There are eight large dumpsters along the mile-and-a-half [1.5 km] coastline of the Strom River that need to be emptied three times a week.
That's how much trash is generated.
However, colder summers have meant that there is a fifth less rubbish than usual.
The third category consists of discarded items.
They're mostly children's toys.
This time Usov has scooped a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They'll be waiting for their owners on the frames leading down to the beach.
"Usually there are more, but this is a normal catch". The believer knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take their toys to bury them again in the sand.
The garbage is scattered
Erika Scholler, a representative of Haaberst's administrative services, admits that the sifting of the tractor disturbs local residents.
The noise, which lasts from the wee hours of the night until the early hours of the morning, disturbs the sleep of neighbors.
During the day, the job is impossible.
You have to sift the beach twice in one month.
"If we don't, the city will fine us", notes Scholler.
However, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, the aim is to get the Ström beach under the international blue flag quality mark.
"Compared to Europe, Estonia has a lot more work to do to maintain its beaches", says Scholler.
We've got more paddles and rocks, and it's harder to sift through the sand.
However, there is less litter on our beaches than anywhere else in Europe.
Hearing about the garbage on the beach, Martin, who lives near the shore of the Strom, involuntarily joins the journalist and the cleanup crew in discussing the current plight of the beach.
In the morning, there's a disgusting picture everywhere.
The problem is birds and bottle pickers who have pulled the garbage bags upside down", reports Martin.
Although it is unlikely that people will be able to change their habits, Martin hopes that the city will do something about the bins, such as putting lids on them to prevent birds from roosting there.
Overall, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Strom waterfront.
You can see the city's taking care of it.
With playgrounds, lighted and freshly paved roads, it has become more pleasant.
There was a time when there was only one way to skate", says Martin.
Treasure hunter finds in the Struma: coins, only coins
Taking advantage of the morning calm, 40-year-old Dimitri scours the beaches like a treasure hunter with a metal detector.
He doesn't think he'll find anything of value today or in the future.
The sea gods aren't generous enough.
"I've been working on it for a year, and so far I haven't found anything worthwhile", says Dmitry.
As an amateur treasure hunter, Dmitri keeps some euro coins, bottle caps, and even dangerous nails in his treasure chest, which he later throws away.
There's usually coins.
"Gold, rings, and the like are not usually found", notes the treasure hunter.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged, as weak economic growth and easing inflation have dampened speculation about increases.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as tightening household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for a hike this month as sluggish economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its Quarterly Inflation Report, the Bank cut its growth forecast to 1,7% in 2017 and 1,6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain as inflation was still expected to rise close to 3% in the autumn.
However, the Bank also indicated that rate increases would be needed over the next few years to contain Brexit-induced inflation and that financial markets may need higher-than-expected increases in borrowing costs.
MEPs also voted to partially reverse the mammoth economic stimulus package triggered by Brexit a year ago.
The Bank will end its term funding scheme, which provides cheap funding to banks, in February, although it has said it now expects a £15 billion increase to £115 billion under the scheme.
In the minutes of its decision on the rate, the Bank states: 'The MPC's medium-term projection of gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak for the foreseeable future, as the difficult situation of households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption.'
Regarding rates, it was reiterated that 'some tightening of monetary policy' would be needed to moderate inflation, and to a 'somewhat greater extent' than expected by the markets.
The stock exchange is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any jumps would be gradual and limited.
The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable with the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The Commission's forecast for 2018 remains unchanged at 1,8%.
Following this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound sterling declined by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make any changes is driven by recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened growing expectations of recovery - GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up slightly towards the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little cause for rejoicing to households suffering from rising inflation and miserable wage increases, saying that things would get a little worse before they got better.
It added that monetary policy could not prevent a hit to incomes over the next few years, but wages were expected to recover significantly towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The weak pound also stimulates the economy by increasing demand for British products, which partly offsets lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were raised to 0.25% last August after the shock EU referendum resulted in a sudden weakening of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for prices and the economy to recover fully.
Prior to the Bank's latest decision, there had been increasing calls for an increase in the rate, as inflation had increased pressure on distressed households; in July, three policymakers called for an increase to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the bank said this was expected and was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess over the 2% target was entirely due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: 'Given the recent fall in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive again as lenders are hungry for work and hope to end the year on a positive note.
The stock market seems to be particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end, as refinancing, often free of charge and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular.'
The NHS is about to prescribe a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people.
Patients will have access to 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September, following a high court battle over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England has announced that the NHS is now making available to an estimated 10,000 people in an initial three-year clinical trial a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, given before sex, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by around 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite its own claims that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, welcomed the move, announced on Thursday, as a "new large-scale intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "turning point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start enrolling people.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines taken before sexual activity to reduce the risk of becoming infected with HIV.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk.
Taking PrEP before sex means that you have enough of certain medicines in your body to prevent HIV infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sexual activity.
Eligible candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose HIV-infected partners are not receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify eligible people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-positive partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen their GP there can also register with a local sexual health clinic participating in the scheme.
The programme costs £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to receive the drugs this week after an international tender process.
The aim of a clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence about who the medicine is intended for and how it is consumed and used in the wider context.
Stevens said: "This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of mankind's greatest health challenges".
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT, said: "This is a watershed moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted to those who need it and are at risk, has the potential to transform the HIV epidemic in England.
From September, people at high risk of HIV in England will have access, through this NHS-funded clinical trial, to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and not dependent on negotiation with a partner, improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement".
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The priority now is to ensure that a clinical trial is rapidly rolled out across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that we've secured the PrEP trial drug, we're on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.
Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue after months of delays and government foot dragging.
The evidence shows the difference this medicine can make in preventing HIV and stopping the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial brings us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial be rolled out nationally as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to halting the spread of HIV in the community".
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia and decreased in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in the day-ahead market price of electricity between the price areas of Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to EUR 1,94, compared with EUR 7,71 in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the breakdown of the Lithuanian-Swedish connection.
In Estonia the average price of electricity on the stock exchange last month was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour, up 12 percent from June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by 5% to EUR 36,27 per MWh.
In Finland the price was EUR 34,17 and the system price of Nord Pool EUR 26,37 per MWh.
Prices increased by 12% and 7% respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity flowed 75 percent of the hours last month to Estonia and 16 percent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
For the remaining 9% of the hours, there were no next-day transactions between the two countries.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity flowed from Estonia to Latvia 99% of the time and full transmission capacity was used 73% of the time.
On the basis of transactions on the last trading day of July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the electricity exchange price could be around EUR 34/MWh in August and EUR 37/MWh in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the price of electricity generation, increased last month and traded between EUR 5,04 and EUR 5,47 per tonne.
High-rise living - a mezzanine and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate property developer, exchanged her large Knightsbridge home for an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger property", said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would match my price.
I was shown this flat in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day".
Since our first visit, this 93,000-square-foot [93 sq m] apartment has been completely renovated.
Originally a one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage and a mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands", he said.
She hired Erfan Azad from Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to take advantage of the 3.8m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't high enough to add two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand up.
Erfan had to get creative.
"The metal structure is quite complex", he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they were on top of each other without bending.
It was not just a question of building a platform. We used a steel structure so that both the upper and lower spaces were the right height".
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms in a room, one on top of the other, with plenty of dramatic elements.
Halfway up, an antique Retrouvius window with a copper light overlooks the glamorous living room below.
Reflective gold furnishings, silver accents, and retro lighting by Serge Mouille enhance the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, spaciousness and light saturation.
Mirrors have been added at each end of the short corridor to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, a mirrored back wall creates the illusion of a window into another room.
At the entrance, a mirrored cabinet provides storage for all of Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Adding to the charm of the living room is the ability to close off the kitchen area when not in use, creating the illusion of a more glamorous space.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this kitchen, however, is that it has a garage-type lifting door.
"It took some design work", explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, which makes it slide very easily when you push it up".
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne now has 16 square feet [16 sq m], an extra bedroom, and a better floor plan.
"After all, it is the floor space that you are selling - or that gives the property value", says Erfan.
"Real estate agent walks into a room wearing an outdated uniform and makes calculations based on floor space".
Here they have been able to increase the floor space while using quality materials that add luxury to the space.
"Materials are what you touch, and they help you form an emotional attachment to your home", says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the wiring in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the heart sing".
It shows that good design and increased floor space can transform a fairly ordinary apartment into something amazing.
In fact, they may even make you want to stay, as happened to Joanne.
The protagonist, Dane Jensen, is a Chicago skyscraper bounty hunter who competes with a colleague for a promotion.
All that matters is the amount of money earned, which makes all ethics obsolete.
A man sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late at night.
For the first half of the movie, I find myself thinking, this is the corporate version of "House of Cards" -- even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler sound alike.
As the film progresses, however, the more the moralizing intent of the filmmakers becomes apparent.
A life-changing experience for the protagonist is his son's cancer diagnosis.
Now you have to choose between work and family.
A son who dreams of becoming an architect takes his father on walks to the top of Chicago's skyscrapers and makes him think about the things that really matter, like faith, goodness, love... not even missing the Twin Towers disaster.
After the third scene, in which the son opens his father's eyes, it seems that the filmmakers are determined to make the audience cry, for even the most hardened spectator cannot hold back the tears at the sight of a dear boy suffering from cancer.
When the son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally realizes the morality of his work and does a good deed for an old man looking for work.
Now I'm betting in my mind that if the movie has a happy ending, I'll reward my insight with coffee after the movie, but if I'm wrong, I can credit the writer with at least one surprise.
For a moment, I think I'm going to miss my coffee when my wife calls Dane from the hospital and he races down the hall in slow motion towards the palace.
The son, however, has miraculously recovered, and although his father has just lost his job, this too is a positive development, since he now has time to care for the family.
I can feel pretty good about myself. I can predict the end of American drama pretty good.
To tell you the truth, the film is well constructed, all the elements are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the moral is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie will bring in a lot of money.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it for real.
In that case, he'd be the first.
Politico reports that the White House's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information, including news, to President Trump in hopes of keeping him in line.
Here's an excerpt from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with senior officials on his first day in office, he brought up a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix - bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told officials that information had to flow through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information".
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV habits haven't changed.
"If candidate Trump was upset about dishonest media coverage, it paid him to show that he was also being covered honestly by influential outlets", former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "six former campaign workers say the key to controlling Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise".
All right, you know what?
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits were ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory without their interference.
We'll probably never know about the tweets that Trump didn't post.
If his assistants managed to get him out of trouble even a few times, their efforts were worthwhile.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from consistently creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of competing cliques, people are almost exclusively trying to advance their own interests by feeding Trump material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be credible.
In May, Politico reported on the tendency of advisers to feed the president information of questionable strategic value.
One example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher, is this:
"Current and former Trump aides say Trump can react to negative press, especially damaging leaks, with an explosive obsession to find their source.
This was the case in late February, when someone gleefully handed the president a printed copy of an article on the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson's GotNews.com website that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the "source of multiple leaks" to the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for defamation, or that he offered no concrete evidence, or that he has made and retracted false accusations in the past.
"Trump read the article and started asking his staff about Walsh".
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Chief of Staff Rob Porter "have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting the documents that reach Trump".
How'd you manage that?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do exactly the same thing.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still competing for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians who come to the capital from abroad do not hesitate to ask for permission to perform.
There are many foreigners playing music in the center of Tallinn.
Those interviewed by the Evening Post admitted that they were playing in the Old Town without permission from the city council.
The first thing we found near the gates of Viru were three street musicians who had brought the same number of dogs with them.
It was obvious that the musicians, with their Rastafarian hats and tattered clothes, were backpackers who needed a shower.
Despite her appearance, the only woman in the group played the accordion to a cheerful rhythm while a man next to her juggled three balls, beckoning passersby closer.
A third man was sitting next to them on a backpack, smoking a homemade joint in peace.
The three dogs were undisturbed by the passing crowd.
Noemi, who played the accordion, and Bob, who juggled balls, said that they performed on the streets for fun as well as for money.
The purpose of the performance was to raise money for a ticket on a ship leaving for Finland that evening.
When asked if they had asked the city for permission to play music in the Old Town, Noemi and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Second of all, we never stay in any one city for more than a day or two, and we're usually given permits for a month or so.
There's no point in paying for it", Bob explained.
When we returned to the gates of Viru some 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were chasing the musicians away.
The group moved with their backpacks and dogs to the intersection of Viru Center to try their luck.
Three young Polish men also performed on Viru Street. One played the violin, another the clarinet, and the third carried an electronic piano.
"We are here to entertain people, to spread music and joy, and to earn money for fuel and living expenses", explained Mivosh, a pianist in the trio.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that to perform, they need permission from the city government.
"Of course we don't have it", he joked.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, then there's no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we'll go somewhere else, but we have to try", he added.
In July, Eesti Pank purchased EUR 149 million of bonds under the public sector purchase programme of the euro area central banks, bringing its total bond portfolio to EUR 4.36 billion.
The ECB does not disclose further details of the purchases.
Hardo Hansson, Governor of Eesti Pank, has previously explained in reply to a parliamentary question that the Eurosystem CBPP comprises three different purchase programmes: covered bonds, asset-backed securities (ABS) and public sector purchase programmes (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who have sold the bonds to invest elsewhere.
Purchases have the effect of reducing the yield on lower-risk assets, which provides an incentive for investors to take on more risk.
As a general rule, each central bank buys its own government bonds under a public sector purchase programme and no other government bonds are purchased.
Since no bonds have been issued by the Estonian State, Eesti Pank will make so-called replacement purchases within the volume allocated to them.
Replacement purchases are also undertaken by central banks in countries where the supply of bonds under the purchase programme is limited.
According to Mr Hansson, Eesti Pank generally purchases bonds issued by European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank has been purchasing bonds under the APP since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were also purchased, but as of June 2016 Eesti Pank no longer purchases Elering bonds.
Since June, both Elering and Eesti Energia bonds have been purchased by the Bank of Finland on behalf of the euro area central banks.
The travelers bypass the ditch and return to the "millionaire's quarter"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again locked in a fierce battle with determined squatters who have defied the council's moat to win back the land away from their villas.
The travelers have parked their 20 trailers in a field near Solihull Street, dubbed the rich man's "millionaire's quarter".
They've returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after being driven out in May, undisturbed by the ditch the council dug to prevent their invasion.
The tactical team found a weak spot in the perimeter, squeezing their vehicles through an unblocked section that was left open to foot traffic.
Angry pot residents have cursed Solihull council, saying the council is "useless in dealing with the problem".
One anonymous resident said: "They moved in on Monday night after being evicted from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The council needs to be shamed into action because they're useless at dealing with the problem.
The Travelers were there in May, they were driven out, and now they're back again.
There were more last night, probably more tonight".
He added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this sort of thing by getting long fences to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy that I have to keep paying council tax when the council can't even prevent this sort of thing".
A local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last of these travelers leave, and already there's another attack.
This time the number has increased, and even a horse has been seen in the grass".
A Solihull council spokesman said: "We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land near Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull Police to take the necessary legal action to move them as quickly as possible.
It is very helpful in gathering evidence if as many local people as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help to paint a picture for the court when we present the case to them".
Minister of Culture Indrek Saar will be among the guests of the weekend festival, and he is pleased that we have been able to bring the world's top names to Estonia.
When asked why the Weekend festival is so important to Estonians, Saar replies that it should be asked to all those who enjoy the three days of the festival to the fullest.
However, he admits that real experts in their field have arrived in Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home - this does not often happen in our region", says the Minister of Culture.
Which artists perform at the festival but Saar himself is the most talked about?
I consider myself a relatively old person, and for old people like me, certainly one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who performed last night.
Judging by the way he spins his record, all of us have done it at one time or another", he says.
Yeah, but he's got a bunch of other names, like the Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
And, of course, our Estonian heroes, starting with NOËP.
In fact, this concentration of well-known names is very high", he says.

Audi renews up to 850,000 diesel cars amid criticism from carmakers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer the software upgrade to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the chairman of BMW, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, which have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it will retrofit three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
None of the companies described these actions as recalls.
European car manufacturers have aggressively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrous oxide from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
It will also increase the cost to car manufacturers of installing equipment to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German automakers are under intense scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of pandering to powerful automakers and ignoring warning signs.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called defeat devices that allowed the emissions to be adjusted to meet regulations while the car was being tested, only to withdraw under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics division of Audi's engine development division was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore not protected against extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when authorities accused it of installing the Audit system to evade European emissions standards, expanding an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could be a major blow to Volkswagen - the luxury carmaker generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
Flags of the European Union will be purchased for Estonian schools at a cost of EUR 20 000.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy European Union flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
A total of 570 educational establishments will display the flag of the European Union, measuring 105 by 158 centimetres.
The flags are designed to be displayed indoors and must be printed with high-quality printing technology indoors, including with a tunnel attachment, reports the ERR news portal.
The sign on the flagpole reads: "A gift to Estonian schools to commemorate Estonia's first presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is around EUR 20 000 according to the Ministry of Education, or EUR 35 per flag.
Murder of journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gathers on Wednesdays to review plans for covering the latest chaos in Sinaloa state, which has been plagued by organized crime, corrupt officials and an ongoing drug war.
But today, they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their safety.
They are told that it is important to change their routine.
Two elderly journalists debate whether it is safer to bring their children to an office that was bombed in 2009 or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: "enemies", "neutrals", "allies".
They ask reporters to provide names for each column - no evidence needed, just impressions and hunches.
Suspected government or cartel employees include drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists - a list of villains that makes reporting on the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as more bodies pile up across the country, more of them are journalists - according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have been placed under state protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year, at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
Among the latest to die is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist", wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be felt everywhere - on the facade of the Riodoce building hangs a large picture of Valdez pointing his middle finger with the words "Justice" and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his characteristic Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after her death, and the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, their insomnia, their paranoia.
Although a separate state prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted.
As with most murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime, which number in the thousands each year, the killers of journalists rarely face justice.
The editorial staff of Riodoce continues to cover the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without information about the killers and justice, Ibarra said the security meeting would be of little use.
"It's very silly to waste your time in this meeting", he says.
"Until you know the reason, you distrust everyone".
Valdez left the Riodoce offices in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before two men in a red Toyota Corolla stopped him, forced him out of the car, and shot him 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name, which translates to "the twelfth river".
The gunman drove off in Valdez's car and crashed nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Word travels freely in Culiacan.
But for the most part, Valdez has remained silent.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the power vacuum.
It does not matter that a person or several people are gunned down each day on the streets of Sinaloa or that the cemeteries are filled with lavishly decorated double mausoleums of drug lords larger than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a moment that peacetime refers to when a coastal state with valuable ports and drug routes into the United States is run by a single cartel.
Despite all this, and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the risks involved in his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, co-founder and director of Riodoce, feels immense guilt for not having been able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the killing.
The first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the head of a rival warring faction of the cartel.
This piece may have angered the sons - suspected gang members bought up all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newsstands.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid on another newspaper covering the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be around forever.
He was working at the newspaper Noroeste in 2003 as a veteran reporter when he teamed up with five colleagues to create Riodoce by selling $50 shares.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem".
In time, the paper gained a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters enjoyed publishing powerful investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were captivated by the printed page, where they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) for his courage in following the Mexican drug cartel wherever it leads.
He freely admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to go on living", he said as he accepted his AAC award.
In an interview with Rompeviento TV last October, he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to embrace the responsibility that comes with being a journalist - the alternative is to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't say what was happening".
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker who cursed like a sailor, a friend who gave hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He would go to the El Guayabo bar across the street from the office and always sit at the same table.
Now they wonder if her love of routine was her undoing.
His death has also made them question how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you mess with their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs".
"You're not supposed to touch those things", Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is intense self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells fishy, stay away.
According to Andrés Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived . . . and that is what happened to Javier".
He and others say the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt public officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Cell phones were suddenly not allowed in the room where Riodoce employees gathered for security training, days after it was revealed that spyware sold only to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen were seeking relief from the 100-degree-Fahrenheit [40°C] heat under a tree.
The government assigned them to guard Riodoce's office in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood in Culiacan.
Some reporters half-jokingly wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers labeled untrustworthy by the governor himself.
For months, reporters have been traveling to the mountainous countryside where drug gangs have de facto control.
This week's edition of Riodoce covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
Plus, they had a tell-all story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And just a block from the D.A.'s office, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants was robbed by a group of people.
There was no official announcement as to who was robbed or how it happened, so one had to be careful when it came time to write what everyone in town knows - the restaurant is a favorite of both drug dealers and law enforcement.
The reporter learned from public records that the restaurant is registered to a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of politics for most of the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same area, including how Guzman's son, nicknamed El Chapo, escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best source of information on kidnapping.
"Earlier we would have known what happened", said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose slender build has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"All channels of communication with our sources have now been cut".
Valdez's office has become a repository for signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff has become something they never expected - activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and headed to the district attorney's office the next morning to protest another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared from the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez's murder.
A burned body has been found, and officials say DNA tests confirm it's his.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS press" on sidewalks and buildings in an organized protest.
On that day, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's death, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be directed away from covering the government, concerned that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "confined" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs but also by politicians and security forces allied with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to the police and state officials.
"In Mexico, you will die because they want to silence you", Ramirez said.
The murders obviously have a blood-thirsty effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a note allegedly signed by the Los Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my reports".
Next to his decapitated head lay a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of its correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others carry on, as did the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke out against drug cartels with the front-page headline "What Do You Want From Us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
This is a nerve-wracking decision.
In exile, jobs are hard to find, and they still have to patrol the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes they are persecuted, as is believed to have happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four other women in 2015 in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay put and keep working have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that covering the drug trade terrifies him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter", he said.
On a recent Friday at midnight, after the latest issue had been locked up, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk outside their offices, drinking beers, when suddenly everyone's phone began to vibrate.
In the coastal resort city of Mazatlan, 19 people were confirmed dead in gun battles between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several cartel messages found in the area.
From that sidewalk, reporters used cell phones to upload the story to the Riodoce website.
The next day, the front page needed a change.
Sirens blared as another shooting took place in the area.
Bojorquez peeked at the officers on duty to see if they were awake.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Under a massive portrait of the fallen newspaper founder, with his middle finger visible throughout Sinaloa, Riodoce editors retraced his steps.
"How could I even think about closing", Bojorquez said, "when the day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send him to cover the streets?"
The dinosaur used protective paint to ward off predators.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, although quite scary.
Scientists have now released the first findings about an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered in a Canadian mine that is so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that its armored skin was a reddish-brown color and that its past had been somewhat "complicated".
A report in the journal Current Biology described the creature as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found" and "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a new species of nodosaur that lived in the mid-Cretaceous period, 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its remarkable preservation stunned researchers, who described it as "truly remarkable".
This armoured herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk while he was mining at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He spotted something unlike the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
For the next six years, work was done to excavate the animal from the 2,500-pound (1,100-kilogram) plot.
After all this hard work, the final product is finally ready to be presented to the public.
"If you squint a little bit, you can almost believe it's asleep", said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display.
"This will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
Examining its skin, scientists found that this herbivore, although covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, was likely threatened significantly by carnivorous dinosaurs.
This heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white paint to hide from predators and a camouflage technique called countershading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This, say experts, allowed the dinosaur to blend in better and avoid predators, since larger dinosaurs were likely hunting it.
This 110-million-year-old creature of the nodosaur family first hit the news in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli, after Mark Mitchell of the museum's laboratory, who was part of the team that spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering the animal.
Thanks to the specimen's remarkable preservation, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the animal's body.
They discovered countershading, a common defense mechanism in the animal kingdom, meaning that the creature's upper half was darker than its lower half.
Although common, the finds come as a surprise, since Borealopelta are much larger than the shelled animals alive today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was being actively hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs, so evolution favored hiding over confrontation as a survival tactic.
But most modern repellent animals - such as deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable to prey, suggesting that nodosaurs really struggled to survive.
"The aggressive hunting of an enormous and heavily armoured dinosaur shows how dangerous Cretaceous predators could be", said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the creature for clues to its life, including the preserved contents of its gut to determine what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was carried by the current to the sea, where it sank backwards to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely extended farther inland than they do today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved armoured skin, but it also remains three-dimensional, retaining the original shape of the animal", Brown said.
"As a result, the animal looks much as it did in the Cretaceous period.
It doesn't take much imagination to reconstruct it - all you have to do is squint and it looks as if he were asleep".
The Cretaceous Period was a time when giant, two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs called theropods roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its fearsome predecessors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a monster 38 feet long and weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose recent findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was washed out to sea after death and mummified in mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk while he was mining at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and scales, and it is intact from the cone to the hips.
These creatures averaged 18 feet (5 meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch spikes protruded from its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armoured herbivore roamed across what is now western Canada until a flooded river washed it out to sea.
But the dinosaur's burial under the sea helped preserve its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the bumpy plates of armor along the dinosaur's skull are still covered with skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: "This level of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Petrified skin still covers the jagged plates of the animal's skull.
The right forefoot rests next to him, and five toes are extended upward.
I can count the number of scales on his feet".
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9th, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was in complete shock.
Just one day after arriving in New York City, this St. Louis resident was sitting on her bed in an Airbnb room, surfing Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post by an old schoolmate.
It said, "An 18-year-old has just been killed by the police and is still lying in the street".
He was confused why no one else had posted this information on his feed, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The likes of @TheePharoah's posts were repeatedly shared on his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area live-tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying in the street for four hours.
"This is crazy", Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
She put her phone away, but later that night, she saw another tweet, this time announcing a crowd gathering on Canfield Drive.
Photos were shared of police tape and people screaming and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He was watching a live feed of a police officer standing with a barking dog in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, he said another policeman brandished a gun and shouted: "I'll kill you all... animals".
Ferrell remembers thinking, "This is unusual".
"This isn't the kind of murder we're used to or what we'd call typical".
At that moment, I felt fear.
I was angry and crying".
She booked a return flight and flew home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she went to her father's house to pick up her six-year-old daughter and decided that the two of them would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, Whose Streets?, which opens in theaters August 11.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the perspective of the people who live in this community and filled the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell and his daughter - wearing a floral dress and a matching crown - drove toward Ferguson, they renewed a conversation they had had many times before that morning - about the black experience and living conditions.
"Remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" he remembers asking himself.
"We're on our way to Ferguson right now because an 18-year-old boy was killed by the police, and it's not right".
"I couldn't not take him with me", Ferrell said later.
"What is happening now is the culmination of what has happened in the past.
He needs to know it and see it and grow up around it.
She needs to learn about activism and organizing, but she also needs to learn about the different layers of black experience and conditioning and what we need to do to break free and liberate ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise her without her personally experiencing blatant racism, she's no different than any other black girl.
I feel I would be doing her a disservice if I protected her from this world".
The first stop they made when they got to Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, across the street from the police station, which had become a kind of campground where activists waited for news of Officer Darren Wilson, who was ultimately not charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunches.
They put together food bags and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new kind of activism was slowly taking shape.
"My activism completely changed after August 9", she said, noting that when she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Nursing Student Association and focused on food rights and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no organizational experience.
It all just worked out".
Weeks later, at an evening rally, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said that he and cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was happening.
The question in Farrell's mind was, "Are you trying to document what's going on, or are you trying to find a story to exploit?"
Such skepticism was prompted by countless cases of people - often white - coming into a community and trying to profit from its pain and resilience.
In a recent interview, Folayan explained: "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson were not being heard, and we wanted to do something different".
Folayan had already teamed up with co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism with death row inmates.
His involvement made the project intriguing to Ferrell and six other locals who were followed by the "Whose Streets?" team for years after Brown's shooting.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we speak for ourselves", said Davis.
"It was important to me how these people were portrayed because that's how I was portrayed".
While the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement was not about "a savior leading, but about bringing a community together", as Folayan put it - she emerged as the film's most outspoken participant.
As a result, Whose Streets? documents surprisingly personal aspects of Farrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked", said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw the finished canvas.
"But I realized that to do this work, to humanize black people, you have to have a certain vulnerability".
More than that, Ferrell's story highlights and re-centers the role of the black lesbian woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the #BlackLivesMatter social media movement following the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 are gay.
"Black lesbians in leadership have generally held the movement back", said Ferrell, "and that's because we have to constantly fight on multiple fronts.
Black homosexual women have to carry the whole burden".
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is really kept alive by black women, and many of them are black lesbians".
He claims, however, that "this is not an equal opportunity type of thing" - Ferrell was not chosen to be the focus of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person with the right energy", she said.
"But it's not a coincidence that she was on the front lines, because as a black homosexual woman living in hot spots like this, there's a lot at stake.
His energy can be felt through the screen".
Meanwhile, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but race relations between the community and the police remain tenuous.
Ferrell's probation for blocking a highway during a protest is up for another two and a half years.
He describes the socio-political climate in the area he calls home simply as "grass-roots".
However, he still holds dear a mantra that has been etched in his memory since he walked the streets of Ferguson a mere three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains".
7 Tips for Getting Over a Hangover After a Weekend of Party
Some of the tougher guys find that after a few drinks at a party, it helps.
Or as they say, "Avoid the hangover, stay drunk".
But that's just the inevitable procrastination and the healthy spending.
What can you do today and tomorrow to feel better in the morning after a weekend of partying - or any other celebration - and to get over a hangover as painlessly as possible?
Have some water.
Alcohol on and off, after a big party in the morning... or preferably even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when it drinks alcohol, it has to replenish itself somehow.
Minerals are also flushed out of the body with water, so it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after a drink, it is especially good if it is fizzy or lightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
Certainly, going to your grandmother's house with a hangover to chop wood would be a fatal mistake.
But a brisk walk will help your body remember what it feels like to be alive again.
Lying in a tent and sleeping off a hangover is a more time-consuming way to recover.
Restore the body's energy slowly and carefully.
If you're already vomiting from last night's overeating, there's no point in trying to load your stomach with a big, fatty steak.
Start with freshly squeezed juice, for example, as the sugars contained in the fruit gently stimulate your body.
If you're feeling a little under the weather for lunch, you might try something like broth.
And a little later, the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will rid your body of any remaining water.
Like they say, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on the painkillers.
If you take a painkiller at night to prevent a hangover, your liver has to deal with acetaminophen or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and loses its performance.
You'll damage your liver even more, and the hangovers will get worse.
Besides, the painkillers don't last long in the body anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, do not take it on an empty stomach - it will upset your already upset stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you're fine on your own.
It's kind of like walking, but you don't have an orgasm walking.
However, avoid overly active paces and wild postures - physical exertion during a hangover should be moderate.
You got to be kidding me.
Have silly conversations with fellow sufferers, do simple silly things, and laugh at yourself and others in a friendly way.
Jokes and laughter may not cure a hangover, but they certainly make the aftereffects more bearable.
I'll get over the hangover one of these days!
A Northwestern professor and an Oxford University employee are wanted on suspicion of murder.
Police say a nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who have become suspects after the body of a man with fatal stab wounds was found in a Chicago luxury apartment.
According to Cook County court documents, non-bailable warrants were issued Monday for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Latham and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of first-degree murder in connection with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to court documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died from multiple stab wounds.
According to an alert issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a phone call and arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building to find the victim with multiple stab wounds.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators are treating the stabbing as a homicide, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
University vice president of public affairs Alan K. Cubbage said in an emailed statement that Lathem has now been suspended and banned from Northwestern University's campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the proper authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation", Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior lecturer in finance at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been in contact with British police and stand ready to assist US investigators in any way we can".
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues are shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chicago Police Department Communications Director Anthony Guglielmi is urging the suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
"Police have an idea of where they are, but we are working intensively to determine their exact location", said Guglielmi.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional, and national authorities are helping to search for the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to police descriptions, it was a gruesome sight.
According to Guglielmi, it is not clear whether the event itself also took place on 27 July.
He said the security cameras confirm Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim were having a relationship", Guglielmi added.
In a letter to residents, the Grand Plaza management stated: "Police are currently working to establish the chronology of events and the victim's background, and are investigating various motives, including the possibility of a domestic dispute".
Startups to help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys were unproductive.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or worse, misleading.
And even though he promised anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
"The system just wasn't consistent or objective", said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a San Francisco-based e-commerce hair-care company with 75 employees.
So he called in outside help.
There's a new breed of human resources start-up emerging that helps companies figure out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software with the explicit goal of measuring employee engagement, they enable companies to conduct snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and a complaint hotline, and in some cases allow native speakers to bypass C-level executives and go directly to the board.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit for health tracking, but where is Fitbit for your business?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett says that in the three years he has been using Glints, he has gained much insight into what his employees think and feel.
In addition to snap surveys and interviews with specific teams, it offers a corporate heat map that shows which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, enabling it to identify the causes.
Companies are starting to realize that they need to keep up with their work culture in order not to become the next Uber, which has been embroiled in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing a harassing environment that punished those who dared to speak out.
For startups like Glint, the desire for insight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, has seen an increase in interest and activity this year in the wake of Uber's questionable reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glintk, Convercent allows companies to send customized pulse surveys, collect real-time confidential responses, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous hotline for employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the CEO is involved, complaints go straight to the board.
"Public opinion has been hijacked by regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employee awareness of policies and procedures and to provide an easy way to communicate with corporate headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or an e-mail address at corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a daunting and inconvenient process, said Ruby Tuesday general counsel James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
But now that the company is using Convercent, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices that previously went unnoticed by managers in offices in other cities or states can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees", said Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"And we protect our shareholders from lawsuits with employees".
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behavior, values, and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, after the collapse of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm because of ethical violations related to the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media matured" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from being publicly laundered online.
"Before technology was used to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a periodic fee for the use of their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that has the endorsement of venture capitalists who have been supportive of both startups.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms including Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the total raised to $47 million.
Glinti received a $10 million investment from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, bringing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments are not surprising given the links between business, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that today's workers expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy at a company, feel listened to and that the work they do is fulfilling, they are more committed to the success of the company", said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glints.
Investors make money when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are engaged and involved.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement, it's no wonder they're gaining traction.
Having data on employee involvement is important, say work culture experts.
But this data is useless if the company's supervisors don't do anything with it.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that change is coming.
And if change is not happening fast enough or at all, it can lead to frustration and reduced employee engagement.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be prepared for 4,000 interviews", said Russell Raath, president of Kotter International, a management consulting firm, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because when things don't get done, employees think, 'Did you really listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts employee surveys once a month, has been able to take action the same day the problem is reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees who were frustrated with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with the problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays will gather new data on employees and it is hoped that in the long term this will lead to a longer-term commitment of employees in an industry known for its high labour turnover.
"If you're not committed to transparency, you lose people", Vitrano said.
"And when you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose business".
The euro area 's shining star is the Baltic: incomes are rising fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have affected the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the income levels of the rich countries of Western Europe, reports Bloomberg, citing a report by the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, since 1999, GDP per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Low debt levels, rapidly improving institutions and pro-business and pro-free market policies have contributed to this success.
'The Baltic States, together with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where real GDP per head in purchasing power terms is significantly close to the EU average,' the central bank said.
While the aim is to bring GDP per capita to parity with richer Western Europe, in 2015 the GDP per capita of the Baltic economies was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Balts to seek better pay abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is expected to grow this year, the local population is far from enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of people in Latvia and Lithuania consider their economies to be doing very well or fairly well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of the respondents felt this way about their national economies.
The NCAA's decision to cancel twice-daily practices is making the Bruins' days long.
It's almost 11:00 p.m. when a group of UCLA football players stop to chat on the edge of the team's new on-campus practice field.
Some of them have peeled off their shirts, revealing their sweaty backs from the first day of training camp.
For many of the crew, these power minutes provide a midday break.
After a three-hour training session, players attending summer courses head back to the dorms to study for final exams before returning the next morning at 6:30 for meetings at the Wasserman soccer complex.
"The next three days are going to be a real challenge for them", Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel twice-daily practices to reduce player workload has actually made their days longer - at least until they're halfway through finals on Friday.
For this reason, the first three practices at UCLA were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the players' already busy schedules.
Moving from two practices a day means more one-day practices - the start of the Bruins' training camp was moved up almost a week from last season and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons, practices will take place during summer training.
They have 18 practices scheduled through August 20 before the official start of training for the opener against Texas A&M in September.
Mora says he's in favor of the NCAA rule change, even though it adds another agenda item to the players' busy schedules.
"They have a huge workload for three or four days, and it's a real challenge", Mora said.
"And they're getting through it; they're working hard, they're great kids.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it will be really nice".
Once the camp is over, UCLA will close practice, which is no easy task, given the clear view of their fields from the adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that's already been hit by footballs that have escaped the net surrounding the goal post.
Starting this weekend, the hotel will be occupied by Bruins players, but Mora acknowledged there could be problems with vacancies during the season.
"We're taking precautions", said Mora.
'This is a real concern and it is not unreasonable to think that people can rent a room and film a training session.
If you have a recording of a workout, you can get a pretty good deal on it.
But we'll use a security team there and in parking lot eight.
We do the best we can with what we've got.
I'm trying not to worry about it too much.
We have a plan in place".
The Savisaare-Ivanova electoral alliance, which was born as a revenge for the Centre Party, the Meie Tallinn electoral alliance, which was created by combining the forces of Kristiina Ojuland, who was expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, who was forced to leave EKRE, and the Tegus Tallinn electoral alliance of businessmen, which was created to take revenge on the party members - it seems that the electoral alliance created on the initiative of those who were burned in party politics will participate in this year's local elections at least as much as the parties.
The chicks will be counted in the fall, and the key question will be whether there are enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who's going to stay on Savisaar?
The extent to which Edgar Savisaar's supporters have dwindled can be seen from the events organised in honour of his electoral alliance.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current members of the Centre Party and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral coalition?
And can the reason why some of Savisaar's loyal supporters and friends are keeping him away from running in Tallinn be found in the fact that the "Savisaar List" of those excluded, headed by corrupt individuals and those suspected of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video for a Russian-language pop song filmed on the roof of the City Hall, with the participation of the mayor of the Lasnamäe district; and an original computer game in every sense, in which the main character, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, has to avoid puddles and squirrels while riding his bike - is this how the Centre Party tries to win the votes of 16- and 17-year-old voters who are allowed to vote for the first time?
It remains to be seen what other parties think of a youthful election campaign.
If, from the beginning of August, viewers of Kanal 2 or TV3 are faced with a black box instead of an entertainment programme, they will have two choices: either accept that in future they will only be able to watch ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinna TV and the English-language France24 channels on free-to-air television, or hand them over to one of the ten television operators each month.
There are also likely to be those who openly rejoice at an ad-free TV experience at first but who end up paying - albeit reluctantly - for the picture and the ads.
Loud music, noisy crowds, and litter are unpleasant side effects of nearly every major music festival.
If you don't want to be part of the noise yourself, it's better to go and discover your home country instead of having a headache at home - and let the festival guests sleep there for a hefty sum.
Washington's changing the rules on green cards.
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying that a new U.S. immigration plan would change the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the president supports them.
The bill will now go to both houses of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayer dollars by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The bill will reduce chain migration and begin to replace the current program.
The new application process will give preference to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and skills that will benefit our economy", Trump was quoted as saying by US media.
The young people of the Siberian Seto are moving to the city, the old people back to the country.
Anatoly Yevseyev carries on the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners along the river Maana.
He works as a driver in a gold-mining town 90 miles [140 km] from home on the Kuvai, a tributary of the Mahanadi River.
It's hard work: two months straight with no days off, 12 hours of work, and then just ten days at home and back again.
In fact, in his three years at Artell, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
"There are strict rules: when you enter, you are checked for vodka, and when you leave, you are checked for gold", says Anatoly.
Mare Piho talks to Jaani, a native Seto from a Haida village, who has told her many memories of her family in Siberia.
The surviving archaic culture of the Siberian Setos is starting to affect the home Setos because it's just so amazing, according to Piho Mare, who has studied the most remote Setos.
This year marks the 30th anniversary of his first expedition to Siberia.
In that time, he has visited 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many Setes migrated to Siberia in the late 1800's and early 1900's to take up land here?
It's an open question.
I say eight thousand.
I figured it out from the stories of the Seto men in Siberia who've thought about it themselves.
It's hard to say exactly, because at the time, up to 30 people could come in a group, but the passport was only issued to a man.
Only one was issued a passport, but he had children, sisters and female relatives with him.
Look at the size of this territory here!
It was several times the size of the historical Setoma.
It had to be cultivated, managed somehow.
The Setos came here as farmers, but their lives changed, because here they found themselves in areas that were not only associated with agriculture, but also the river (log rafting), gold mines, industry.
For example, in Ulyanovsk, many setos later went to work in the secret city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (where the Soviet authorities built a uranium enrichment plant - J. P.), when it was formed.
Were Setos the majority population in this area at that time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
There was also a long-standing tradition of intermarriage and polygamy.
Seven or eight children in a family was common.
How did the culture of the Siberian Setos differ from that of the native Setos?
They're different, even though what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of folk costumes with them.
They also made their own, but they always made a distinction between what was brought and what was made here.
Climate change has greatly affected the traditional dress of the Setos because it's colder here.
The food's changed.
For example, in Setoma, meat was salted, but here it was simply frozen.
Where are the villages of the Siberian Setos located, and what is life like there? / graphic by Alari Paluots
The bond with the motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now it's starting to give Setumaa back there, it's starting to affect them.
These girls who have lived with families here have heard amazing stories.
Piho is referring to a delegation of Estonian Seto people who came to a Haida village for Seto Kingdom Day in early July and lived in the homes for four days. - J. P.
What's left here, it's amazing.
"It is very easy to get to and from Tapa because of its excellent location at a railway junction and a crossroads", says Reigo Tamm, an opera soloist from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural venues and pizza can be found everywhere.
Tapa is a great town!
There is a small island on the White River, which runs through the city, where the Tapa people hold a yankee festival.
"You can't see this beautiful place from the train window", sighs Reigo.
If you're not afraid of cold water, you can swim in this river, because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, I can handle it!
You can have a picnic by the river and just be romantic and watch the river go by and think about life backwards and forwards.
I've walked there with my girlfriends.
Among other things, Tamm, an opera singer, has gone to the riverbank between three bridges to practice his arias: "Since this place is on the edge of town, no one may come when I hum my songs".
"The pine hill offers a wonderful view of Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and now play disc golf, for example - a golf course has been built, skis can be rented from the sports centre", says Reigo.
The old pros go there with their records, of course, but I haven't gotten to play there yet.
We will probably have to invite our colleague Rasmus Kull Tapa to visit us, because he is an experienced disc golfer and he has discs.
Maybe he'll lend it to me!
Reigo and Pine Mountain were inseparable during the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during skiing lessons.
This hill has left many tears, disappointments and victories in my sporting life.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
"The whole city centre is under construction now, it's all changing beyond recognition", admits Reigo.
However, the tired old waxworks of Tapa is a very attractive venue for summer productions.
I am glad that in 2012 the director of R.A.A.A.M, Märt Meos, accepted my idea and came with his theatre to do a summer theatre in Vaxjo.
Although this year's theatre season with "Alexei Karenin" has just ended, on 11 August there will be "Awakening" at the railway station, when the old waxworks building will be taken on a tour in the 1980s.
"From August 11 to 13, Tapa City Days will be held, during which home-style cafes will be open after the town hall wakes up and a series of cultural events, including a folk rally, will take place", says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city during these days.
The small yellow house on the Boulevard du 1er Mai has been a museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are plentiful and the information overwhelming", says Reigo of the place, which is full of Tapa's history, much of it focused on the railway and the military.
Reigo complains that if Tappa visits all the recommended places, his stomach will eventually get empty, but fortunately the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good places to eat, and sitting in cafes sometimes makes you feel like you're in a foreign country", he says.
Educated and young soldiers who come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there you have a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and your hometown, but surrounded by such an international crowd.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we move a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
bTV quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying that two Bulgarians had been arrested in Greece for camping illegally.
On the morning of 1 August, the police arrested a group of people, including two Bulgarians, who were camping illegally on the peninsula of Sithonia.
They were released the same day, but there's an ongoing investigation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on open-air camping and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone caught camping in a non-designated area.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the court may impose a fine.
Wolves who train puppies train sheep.
After a year's hiatus, Highland farmers must once again feed their herds to the wolves for "educational purposes" - apparently, the wolves that trained the cubs have already tamed a number of sheep.
Wolves have attacked sheep in Hiiu County three times this year, injuring eight and injuring 23 in all, reports Hiiu Leht.
Last year, there were only three. The year before, 124.
According to data from the Environment Agency, no wolf packs were born in Hiiumaa last year, and according to information from the Hiiumaa Hunting Council, two wolf packs have been recorded on the island this year.
On the night of Monday, wolves attacked 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in Emmaste municipality, injuring half of the 18 surviving sheep.
Early Wednesday morning, in a pasture in the village of Reheselya, wolves mauled one sheep and badly injured another, which had to be euthanized.
Rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law amending the Act on the Release of Genetically Modified Organisms into the Environment (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act for approval.
The amendment to the Act abolishes the requirement to create a separate database for both the location and the operators of genetically modified (GM) crops, using the Plant Health Register.
In addition, the obligation for the operator of the GM crop to have a prior agreement with a beekeeper within a defined radius is modified.
Although no genetically modified crops are currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non-modified crops.
This will continue at least until Estonia has decided to declare itself GMO-free", said Sigmar Suu, head of the Plant Health Department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
'At the same time, it must be borne in mind that the measures developed must be appropriate and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors,' Suu added.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the location and operator database of GM crops in the GMOVS and handling training, establishes the requirements for handling GM crops and starting economic activity.
Specifically as regards beekeeping, the current obligation for the GM crop grower to inform the beekeeper of the start of cultivation of the GM crop will be replaced by an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for approval.
All interested parties can consult the draft in the information system and, if they wish, submit their comments to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will primarily affect persons active in the field of plant breeding, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
Only one GM crop, MON 810 maize, is authorised for cultivation in the European Union, including Estonia.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has shown interest in growing a GM crop.
This is due to the fact that Estonia is free from the European corn borer, a pest to which maize line MON 810 is resistant.
Also, varieties of this maize line have been bred for the southern regions and this maize is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In order to ascertain the above, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has ordered studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in seeds of different varieties of rapeseed, maize and soybean grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain any foreign genes and the study concluded that the seeds of rapeseed, maize and soybean varieties grown in Estonia do not contain GMOs.
From the above, it can be concluded that no GM crops are intentionally cultivated in Estonia and it was also confirmed that no accidental contamination took place.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited a "genius" in Nemanja Matic after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The £40 million signing from Chelsea started United's final pre-season game in Dublin before Tuesday's 2-1 UEFA Super Cup win over Real Madrid in the starting line-up, impressing in a defensive role while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to move up front.
However, after missing out on the Blues' pre-season tour of Asia, Matic suffered a serious lack of form, lasting only 45 minutes, which Mourinho said he would have to fix before the Premier League season started.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mind - he has a football mentality", Mourinho said.
"Let's get him back in shape as soon as possible".
Like Matic, other new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began to quietly establish his one-man starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho is still looking to sign three more players, but he insisted that the club has already done a "great job" in signing three of his top four picks.
'I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three of the four,' he added.
"I'll be even happier if they can do four out of four, but they've worked hard for me".
Another son-of-a-bitch got a GSM transmitter on his leg on August 1st, and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a birdwatcher who lives in the Gorge, the first fledgling in the Gorge has been fitted with a transmitter, and the flock is already circling, having left the nest and joined the large overnight flock at Mullutu-Suurla Bay.
That's because there's no cornfield in the Fens, says the Voice of the Islands.
On this Tuesday, relatively late in the season for cuckooing, another cuckoo chick joined the party on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of the transmitters is actually an international project led by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a son of a bitch named Mati got a GSM transmitter in Sõrve, Turkey.
"Everything he did can be viewed on the Internet: how he went to Spain for the winter, spent a long time at the German and Polish borders when he came back, and then came to Saaremaa", said Martinson.
A British inventor had a microchip implanted in his body so that he could access his home and car by waving his hand.
A British inventor has become the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip, enabling him to unlock his front door, gain access to his office and even start his car simply by waving his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and now offers the service through his company, BioTeq, to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with consultant anaesthetist Dr Geoff Watson at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure the implant procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to that used to microchip cats and dogs, and the procedure takes just 30 seconds.
Northam's company also replaces locks on houses and cars to match the chip, charging £300 per lock.
This married father of one has now installed the technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4, which activates when his hand is on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost the taxpayers thousands.
According to military documents leaked to TIME magazine, the White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter onto the South Lawn last month for an event celebrating American manufacturing cost taxpayers $24,000.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, referred to as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of a July 17 White House event showcasing America's construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured industrial products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was displayed with a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to documents from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the squadron responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House War Cabinet requested the helicopter's presence with a partial order, or FARGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high profile event", the commander of HMX-1 said in an email to his superior, the Navy's Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Aviation, the day before the event.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at about 7:15 a.m. for the 7:15 a.m. event and would stay until the yard was cleaned up between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. that evening.
It added that if the departure from the White House was delayed, another crew would be needed for the return flight due to time constraints.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event and the squadron security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
The documents provided to TIME magazine did not say whether a second crew was eventually needed or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether the event might violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated the Hatch Act, and we were told it did not", the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice", replied the deputy commanding officer.
The White House declared the event an official "Made in America" event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president endorsed the Senate's health care reform effort and praised efforts to rein in government regulations.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for political gain is not new.
Presidents have to use them to travel.
But the requirement to use them purely for a photo shoot is unusual.
Trump gained attention in February when his presidential plane rolled into the background at his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the 'Made in America' exhibit, which featured products from all 50 states made with American materials by American workers", said Acting White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often make test flights around Washington and the South Lawn to practice landing the President of the United States at the White House with centimeter precision.
While Trump was in Germany for the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 made 58 test landings on the White House lawn.
According to the official, the flight to the "Made in America" event was part of the crew's normal training for the month.
The squadron's helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, none of the other exhibits at the event ever put a dent in the taxpayer's pocket.
According to a Sikorsky representative, the company was not involved in the organisation of the display on the southern apron of the helicopter.
HMX-1 doesn't keep budget documents for presidential flights, and the exact cost of the event is difficult to determine.
But according to the DOD's FY 2017 hourly rates, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
The squadron's flight logs indicated a flight time of 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Station Quantico, Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far less than that amount.
"Calculating the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimated reimbursement rates is highly misleading", said Walters.
'These estimated reimbursement rates include staff, maintenance and a number of other irreversible costs taken into account in the annual appropriations.'
According to the 2015 RAND study, the Department of Defense's reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but do cover fuel, maintenance, and contract-related costs.
Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week", Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are probably hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I believe that, like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and the other military equipment that so many Americans have worked so tirelessly to build.
So, of course, it's right to point that out".
It's unclear whether or not Trump collided with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he was behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, poking fun at the company's products on his personal fleet of aircraft to the media.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the president, "I have three of their products".
Grit Shadeiko - Through Tears Came Peace and Joy
At the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, Šadeiko was hit in the final area, 800 meters ran on a foot ramp, and the maid was carried out of the stadium on a stretcher.
Shortly before that, he had received a zero in the long jump at a university competition in China.
The 2012 European Championships in Helsinki were marred by an injury sustained in the javelin throw, but at her debut Olympics in London, she finished 23rd with 6013 points.
But the bad luck continued.
At the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, after the opening day, the Estonian record holder suffered a thumb injury in the long jump.
Two years later, at the Beijing World Championships, he finished 15th and qualified for the Olympics, but even that was a disappointment for an athlete who wanted more.
Šadeiko's biggest challenge came last year when she failed to score in the long jump at the European Championships in Amsterdam.
I'd just like to put together a proper all-around competition for once.
One time", confessed Shadeiko.
Worse still, a month later she had to withdraw from the Rio Olympics because of a thigh injury at the first hurdle.
Time was running out - should the heptathlon continue at all?
Is two days worth all this effort?
The maiden thought long and hard, but at last she found peace.
It cleared my head.
It's a relatively difficult experience to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Luckily, I had time to heal and clear my head.
"I knew I wasn't going to put the pills in the bag yet", she says of her self-medication.
I was able to turn over a new leaf and move on.
According to coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to watch the athlete's suffering, but she realized that first of all, the athlete had to find himself.
I mean, he was so humiliated by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"But Grit said she's not giving up and she wants to prove herself", says Mountain.
There's a kind of peace in him now.
He's doing it for his own pleasure.
Competition came back in May, when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the Götzise multi-competition.
In a high-level competition, she improved her personal best in the shot put by almost a metre (13.89) and ran a near-record time in the hurdles.
Then the all-rounder felt that this was not the limit of his abilities, but merely the extinguishing of his original competitive hunger.
The Mountain, who has tutored her for years, says that Shadeko is a model student.
He's a ready athlete, he's good to train.
If something's wrong, he'll tell you right away.
She knows her body and she trusts her gut.
That's where we have to start.
I can't tell you exactly what to do, and we follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not a maximalist", he says, adding that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, which will guarantee a good result.
The joys of having a baby nearby
Good emotions have also been provided to Shadeikola by the happiness of loved ones.
Both her former training partner Maris Mägi and her sister Grete recently became parents and the multi-competitor has received support from the new citizens of space.
"It's been really interesting", says Shadeiko.
An alcohol that, when consumed, is equivalent to a brain workout.
Livestrong reports that Dr. Gordon Shepherd is such a big fan of wine that he believes it exercises the brain better than anything else in the world.
Shepherd is a neuroscientist at Yale.
He was referring, not to alcohol or its effect on our emotions and thoughts, but to the "very active" process of tasting wine.
As we sniff the glass, swirl the wine, savor it, and savor the aftertaste, we engage our brain to create the taste of wine.
According to Shepherd, the molecules in wine don't actually contain flavor, but flavor comes from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He uses the analogy of how the brain "sees" color.
"Taste is not in the wine, but in the taster", says Sheperd.
Other factors that affect the taste of wine include our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva we produce.
Of course, Shepherd cautions that wine is not for getting drunk on.
"There's got to be more to it", he says.
If you take too big a sip, the system is overloaded.
According to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine a day risk memory loss, loss of balance, and decreased mental function.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than their colleagues
Data from the recruitment company Fontes reveals that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than their colleagues.
There is a 10 percent pay gap between men and women, reports the portal Geenius.
The Fontese ICT sector wage survey covered 59 IT and telecommunications companies.
A total of 8 577 posts were examined.
63% of the posts were held by men.
"Although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and the remaining companies believe that there is no pay gap, in reality, when comparing similar jobs, men's basic monthly earnings are on average 10% higher than women's and men's total annual earnings are on average 8% higher than women's", said Ilmar Põhjala, an analyst at Fontes.
Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Cali cartel takes center stage in the hit Netflix series
Despite the second season of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and a teaser trailer for the first has already been released, teasing the series with new villains.
In season three, the DEA turns its attention to the world's wealthiest drug organization, the Cali Cartel.
They're run by four powerful godfathers "like a Fortune 500 company", just with more bribes to the government and more violence.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages the connections with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a newly released promotional clip, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pena, a character who recruits American and Colombian law enforcement to help in the war on drugs.
Other new cast members include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos opens September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics.
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can only be representative of the people if all members of society, including women, play a role.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are running for local council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The importance of the role of women cannot be overstated", he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved at all stages of the electoral process.
Local and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban, for their part, have threatened an electoral process that would coincide with a transitional period during which international military operations would have an advisory role.
This year's elections mark the first peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women will increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

From the Philippines to the World - The Shoulder Bag's Journey to the Heart of Fashion
The straw bag is a summer classic that has become a hit in its own right in recent years, a must-have for any true summertime lover, and despite its humble origins, merchants have managed to weld a price tag to match.
A straw bag is probably one of those things that everyone has owned at least once in his life and that does not arouse any particular emotion in him.
It's just there, and if it's not there, it's not broken.
Now, however, shoulder bags are making a real comeback, and fashionistas have traded their elegant designer bags for simple straw-woven bags for the summer months.
Not only is it a beach bag but today it is also popular as a street bag and is even worn to the office by more adventurous women.
At this point, though, it's worth considering whether your boss would prefer a summer look or a more formal look with a notepad and a laptop.
Variety, however, has made shoulder bags a summertime favorite for women.
For example, if you read foreign fashion blogs, one of the first things you'll notice is that when a fashionista goes on vacation, the first thing they do is go to the local market and buy a shoulder bag that they'll wear for the rest of their vacation, to the beach, to the market, to hang out with their girlfriends.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy large quantities of bags from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
Interestingly, the demand for handbags among readers is so great that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably be throwing their arms around each other to win one.
In some ways, this craze is understandable, since it is rare in the fashion world to be able to buy a hit item for just a few dollars.
Of course, shrewd merchants have also discovered an easy way to make money, with high-end brands selling straw bags for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
Probably so the wealthier customers don't have to feel like mere mortals walking around with cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a Dolce & Gabbana straw bag that costs more than a thousand euros.
However, the interpretation of a Chanel shoulder bag can cost up to 6,000 euros.
Unlike most mohawks, however, the origins of the shoulder bag go back much further than that.
In fact, it is said that the origins of the rucksack lie far away in the Philippines, from where it spread around the world.
The weaving of straw sacks is primarily an export trade, and locals are not often seen carrying them around.
The technique is said to date back to the 14th century and is quite similar to regular basket weaving.
Since straw bags do not have to be woven as tightly as baskets, they can be woven with patterns and other materials that add personality and appeal.
For example, in recent years, bags embroidered with colored ribbons or leather have become very fashionable.
But the shoulder bags can thank actress Jane Birkin most of all, who has never been a bigger fan of knitted shoulder bags.
In fact, she matched the straw bag to all sorts of outfits and didn't even have to wear it to the Cannes Film Festival.
Not the least of the reasons for their popularity today is that they are easy to care for and, unlike all other types of pocket gophers, do not require special care, being washed off with water and a wet towel.
As is often the case with trends, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations besides the classic look.
For example, if you wish, you can have a silk scarf made of straw or a small shoulder bag.
However, it is good to remember that the classic straw bag will never go out of style, but the straw mat will.
So, what's a classic straw bag?
For centuries, a woven straw sack, similar in style to a basket, with an open top and short, strawlike heels, has been considered a classic.

GMB is concerned about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union is seeking confirmation from the managers of biscuit maker McVitie's about long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, it has remained silent on the future of the investment in the Tollcross site.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, said they've invested more than £5 million in the facility over the last few years.
Additional workers were hired, and union leaders "are the first to know" when there is a change in operations.
In a letter to the site manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to 'address concerns that funding is not being used to modernise production lines'.
Senior GMB organiser Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we are not getting clarity from the site manager on Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan is of deep concern to our members.
Several generations of families have worked here and the workforce is largely made up of people from the local community and the Glasgow area, an essential pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
Therefore, in terms of jobs, wages and welfare, and in the context of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a fast-growing operation in McVitie'.
A spokesman for Plaidis said: 'The site manager at the Toll Crossing only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company is responding directly as we value active communication with staff and union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting at Tollcross between workers and GMB representatives where a number of issues were openly discussed.
At that time, we discussed with our employees that, like any other company operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our operations on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all of our businesses and facilities - to ensure that we remain competitive.
He added: 'Over the last few years we have invested over £5 million in the Tollcross site, much of it in production lines and improvements to operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility, and should there be any changes to the operations of the facility, employees and union representatives will be the first to know".
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about approaching Neymar?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain are not giving up on Neymar with a £189m bid, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about their record-breaking campaign?
This high-profile approach has opened up the summer transfer window and the Ligue 1 club are set to more than double the current world record for overtaking set last season by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for £89 million.
Once the transfer is completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, earning an after-tax salary of over £500,000 per week from PSG.
Barcelona are understandably angry about both the approach and Neymar's release, although a source close to the Catalan board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the president of PSG warn the football world of this possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any club thinking of signing one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will confront them and contact those players", Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they have to face the consequences".
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer a setback as a result of this interest, losing one of their prized assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit
'Brexit seriously threatens to drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland,' Varadkar warned during his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit", he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible today's free movement of people and goods, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders", he stressed.
Mr Varadkar said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, since it could not, to remain part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make the UK's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the EU and the UK, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could certainly have one with the UK".
The alternative would be a return to the customs posts, which would herald a historic split and political failure.
"An obstacle to trade, prosperity and peace", said the Irish prime minister.
He called Brexit 'the challenge of our generation' and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of daily life in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland during his visit to Belfast.
Märt Avandi, who has completed his first half-distance triathlon:
Today, the winter capital of Otepää hosted the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic States, with about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries taking part in the half-Ironman race.
The 70.3-mile distance consisted of 1.2 miles (1.9 km) of swimming, 55 miles (90 km) of cycling, and 13.2 miles (21.1 km) of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avandi finished his first triathlon victoriously.
"I thought it was going to be difficult, and it turned out to be difficult", admitted Avandi at the finish.
Despite its complexity, Avandi found that the triathlon is actually accessible to almost everyone.
"It's not the distance that kills, it's the pace", he said, implying that almost anyone can finish at a reasonable pace.
Except for Ott Sepp: "Ott is good at physics, but he can't swim".
Avanti had been training hard since February.
Four or five hours a week at first, then ten.
With a time of 5:34:12, he finished 270th overall.
Although Avandi lost to both Raio Piiro (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Lig (time 05:06:37), he beat other competitors in the so-called "celebrity class".
Tanel Padar, who was a "good role model" last year, lost to Avandi by seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan by 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm by about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
German Johannes Moldan was crowned overall winner of the men's Otepää stage of the Ironman series with a time of 3:58:27, the best of the Estonians was Ivo Suur with a time of 04:14:09.
The women's race was won by Helle Frederiksen of Denmark with a time of 04:24:01, while Maria Jänese of Estonia, who lost almost half an hour to Frederiksen, finished with a time of 04:58:58.
Avandi swam a distance of 1.9 km in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in 410 position.
