This not only confirms an already popular theory that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details, such as three-dimensionality and color, not usually provided by fossils.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown above and light or carotenoid below.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of birds' feathers.
Although dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed stalk known as a prehensile tail, the researchers speculate that prehensile tails, like these other features, resemble a later evolutionary development because the feathers have other features - fins and spines.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used to regulate or indicate temperature rather than to fly. Although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers suggest that the specimen shows adult plumage and not the smooth plumage of a calf.
Although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers note that the specimen shows adult plumage and not the slender plumage of a calf.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can easily see that no envelopes have been inserted at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes other than those of duly counted and authorized voters have been added.
Candidates can send delegates to observe every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, following a special procedure.

The Crown Prosecution Service has told the press that it will not comment on the entire prosecution, at least not until the indictment.
According to the leaked information, the document is related to the struggle for borders, that is, the borders as required by Palestine before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered included the future state of Jerusalem, which would be holy to both countries, and the crisis in the Jordan Valley.
Israel requests continued troop deployment in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to grant troop deployment for only five years.
Since the supplementary pest control test was supervised and its effectiveness evaluated, its shooters had to be closely monitored by the rangers.
In conjunction with the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission were given extensive training advice on safety.
A new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) was sworn in by Martelly.
It's Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime in October.
The sometimes-violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some scheduled for 2011.
Approximately 60 defective iPods overheated, causing minor burns to four people, including a total of six fires.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving equipment.
Last week METI announced that Apple had been notified of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The Ministry responded to Apple's postponement of the report as "really sad".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday afternoon).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reported no casualties in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage in their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Ronaldo Mendoza opened fire on tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released earlier, as were two Filipino photographers.
An elderly woman needed to go to the toilet, so photographers later took her place. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in her spare time.
His research showed that when a hormone was administered, it accelerated the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' of flight recorders on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the absolute queen. She was my first manager. She died on the night of the two moons.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is as much a mystery as I am... perhaps more so... she will be loved and missed... and in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the poll, 29% of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three swimming events at the Commonwealth Games, but he says his fitness remains questionable.
Drugs to ease his pain have been banned by the Olympics and he is unable to take them.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
In early February, several people using different hardware and software confirmed the discovery, which was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of organic materials that could have produced the proteins that sustain life on Earth, as well as water.
Scientists believe that long ago, comets collided with the earth, helping to explain the formation of the planets, especially the earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political twaddle and stupidity".
He invested heavily in the 2016 presidential campaign.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that enables aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology to replace older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater accuracy and provide more accurate information to pilots.
Trains running on the surface will not stop at Wembley unless additional transport is provided. Parking and parking at the ground - there are no facilities to use public transport.
Fears of a lack of transportation prompted the team to play behind closed doors without supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species has evolved in two generations. Previously it was thought that this process would take much longer due to interbreeding between the solitary Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza coniorostris.
Gold can be shaped into almost any shape. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be made into a thin wire that can be twisted and knitted. It can be crushed into sheets and rolled.
It could be made very thin and glued onto other metals. It could be made so thin that sometimes hand-painted pictures called "illuminated manuscripts" were used to decorate books.
You can use red cabbage juice as an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Grind the two dry powders together and then knead them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers to form a funnel and create a kind of shell.
Nearly every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a modern sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in Minoan Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of public baths, sometimes mixed with men and women.
When you talk to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call, which is then reflected downward almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Since the earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision, scientists use telescopes in space.
It would take a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to hold a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to make transportation easier and faster.
It has given us trains, automobiles, and many other means of transportation.
They range from hares to antelopes and deer, medium-sized predators, to medium-sized cats.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic feral cats) that eat small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the unique role each cat plays in preventing competition with others.
The most social of the big cats are the lions, which live in large groups called prides.
Prides are made up of one to three related adult males and up to 30 females and their offspring.
Females are usually closely related to one another, being sisters and daughters in a large family.
Lion prides act in a manner similar to a pack of wolves or dogs, surprisingly similar in behaviour to lions (but not other big cats) and very lethal to their prey in behaviour.
A well-built athlete, the tiger is able to climb trees (not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
Tigers are in the same family as lions, leopards, and jaguars (genus Panthera). Only four of these cats are capable of roaring.
and his voice was like the roar of a lion; and he spoke like a lion's roar, and did not open his mouth.
The American bobcat prefers to eat small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds. Most of the animals it hunts are much smaller than the American bobcat.
Scientists believe that American cats locate prey by tracking and sensing their location on the ground by their sense of smell.
They have excellent night vision and are stealthy and agile. American cats blend into their surroundings, stalking and jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (when they cross a mountain range or river or arrive on a new island from which they cannot easily return) they often encounter a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they did before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and they still need the same adaptations they had before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look more and more different from the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this speciation, the emergence of new species. Species selection is an inevitable consequence and a crucial part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants derive their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes and clothes from plants. Many of the things we eat are plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Mesosaurus was the apex predator of its day, fearing nothing but another Mesosaurus.
Its jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set of teeth in the upper part of its mouth, meaning that no one could escape its clutches.
We don't know yet, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mesosaurs, and it may have been an omnivore.
It attacked anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like the T. Rex.
While many of their foods are familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange or unusual diet, including wild boars, monkeys, snails, and rats called domous.
Another is that poor men and women ate sitting on stools, while rich people preferred to eat side by side at banquets.
The ancient Roman diet may not have included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not grow corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted black meat.
The Babylonians built a basic temple for each of their gods and considered it to be the home of the deity.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and ceremonies.
Each temple had an open sanctuary and an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
Despite the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was of little use.
The Jewish family spent a lot of time outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the outlets were the only open windows facing the road. The stones were used to build the houses.
The land of Canaan had few forests, and timber was expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his further journey westward encountered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever his discovery, Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each of these countries was 'Scandinavian,' the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were very different.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you'd think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776" appear upside down on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
No one knows who wrote it, but the huge parchment document (about 29 3/4 by 24 1/2 inches [29 3/4 by 24 1/2 inches]) was originally rolled up for storage.
It is possible, therefore, that the mark was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting the invaders.
The Allies invaded southern France on 15 August 1940, in an invasion known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way back to Germany.
A civilization is a unitary culture, a society in which a substantial number of people live and work together and enjoy prosperity.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and thus refers in some way to the size of a society.
A civilization is meant to carry knowledge, a lasting cultural imprint, and fair publicity across generations.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
Thirteen states united during the Revolutionary War, forming the first weak central government with a Confederate Constitution - Congress was its only component.
Since there was no national executive or judiciary, Congress had no power to impose taxes, and it had to rely on federal authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
It also had no authority over interstate tax laws and duties.
To amend the Constitution, the Constitution required the unanimous approval of all the states, and the states took the central government so lightly that often their representatives did not attend.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, netball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Italians compete in international sporting and Olympic events, and winter sports are most popular in the northern regions.
Japan is made up of some 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Japan is often called an "archipelago" geographically, due to its clusters of islands.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by referred to it as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company, established in southwestern Taiwan, transformed indigenous grain production practices by using Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in which they ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings on the perimeter of the complex have been reconstructed to give visitors a better idea of how the buildings may have originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the process is ongoing.
For example, the world's most commonly used still image photography format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size during the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been overtaken by digital camera image sensor models.
The 35-millimeter format is actually quite confusing, being 36 millimeters wide and 24 millimeters high.
So the aspect ratio (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) of this format is said to be 3:2.
Most common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) will have aspect ratios equal to or very close to this.
The much-maligned and often-ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for keeping the measurements of an image in order and creating dynamism.
This suggests that the ideal location for the main subject is at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the figure into three (see example).
During this period in European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under intense scrutiny.
Despite differences in language and culture, European nations have been bound together by Christianity for more than a thousand years.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the central teachings of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and oppression, and church funds exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and questions were raised as to whether this concentration of power and money satisfied that doctrine.
In the wake of the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy of cutting off vital military and civilian supplies proved effective, although it violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by numerous international treaties over the previous two centuries.
To prevent shipping from reaching that entire part of the sea, the British bombed the international waterway, which also made it dangerous for ordinary shipping.
As there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to their unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of many citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations were determined to avoid such conditions in the future.
In 1884, Tesla came to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison (his manager at his previous job) from Charles Batchelor, and 4 cents.
Ancient China had its own unique way of representing time; each period, or dynasty, in China was unique.
The most famous of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
These periods saw fierce wars between the many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, when thousands died fighting for the highest seat in the Great Wall of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to federalism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
And even after the revolution, jobs were opened up to all male applicants, allowing only the most ambitious and eager to succeed to succeed.
The same was true of the army, where rank was based on ability rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many of the oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane. He used to go to a cave called Hira on the mountain called Nur (Light) to meditate.
The long-standing legend also gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
On a hilltop north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if one knew of its existence, it is not easy to find. Once inside the cave, it is complete isolation.
There is nothing to be seen but the clear, beautiful skies above and the rolling hills beyond.
To this day, the only thing left of the original seven wonders is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the celestial Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of Death, is the site of several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several shrines, and a sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while other smaller pyramids, tombs, and shrines were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper bow" is V-shaped, while the "lower bow" is a staple or square without a bottom.
Going up means that you start at the top of the bow and push, while going down means that you start at the bottom of the bow and pull.
A high bow generally produces a softer sound, while a low bow is stronger and more accurate.
Keep pencil notes as you wish, but remember that printed musical notation exists for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and 4 year old Louis Charles), the King's sister Elisabeth, were sent by a group of market women from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by an angry mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
On one occasion, a member of the mob waved the head of a royal guard slain at Versailles before the fearsome queen.
The burden of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was borne by the Filipino people themselves.
Through Wall Street banks, they were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government for bearing the interest and a major part of the cost of Philippine bonds in the name of the Philippine government.
Indeed, the vast revenues generated by the exploitation of the Filipino people have long been among the primary benefits of American imperialism.
In order for one to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that precipitated the inspiration for the creation of the Church.
The time when these events took place is generally considered to be the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries of the High Middle Ages period of European history (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which generally end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a practically wide range of ideas, from technological impetus or technological necessity to an underlying reason for being bound by scientific laws and a strong sense that human destiny is guided by technology in expressing them.
Most definitions of technological determinism hold two concepts in common: that technological progress takes a path that goes far beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology "influences" natural societies more than socially conditioned societies.
For example, one can say that the automobile is inevitably responsible for the development of roads.
However, it is not economically feasible to have a nationwide road network for only a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Large-scale car ownership creates an increased risk of road accidents and leads to the search for new methods of health care to repair damaged body parts.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural criterion, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and culture associated with that geography arose, and these conformed to the place in society rather than arbitrarily imposed rules.
Just as Paris is now known as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of colonial Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts of silks and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this time that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Between the 10th and 11th centuries and into the 14th century, Gothic culture reached its zenith.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western fashion may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own styles. One of the greatest developments that resulted was the introduction of buttons to tighten the clothing of the Crusaders.
Dependent agriculture is agriculture that produces only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic approach using seeds native to the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple yield-enhancing techniques.
Since ancient times, many farmers have engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who are ignored by social norms and allow them to build an identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The attributes that make a subculture distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often signal their membership in specific and symbolic ways through styles, rituals, and dialects.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to focus on children who have suffered several unfortunate events, such as not being properly socialized by adults at a growing age, being neglected, unfortunate, or deliberately abused.
Such children are called "violent" or unruly. Some violent children have been ostracized by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases a severe intellectual or physical disability may be the reason for a child being rejected by these parents.
Before being abandoned or fleeing, these violent children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma.
Some are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully adopted by non-human animals, unruly children (within physical limits) show the same fear or dislike of humans as the protected animal.
While project-based learning should make learning easy and fun, Scaffolding goes one step further.
Providing support is not a method of learning, but simply a support given to those having a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalised within the software and they are intended to question, interrogate and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and extortion.
This is despite the fact that no child should have to grow up in an environment that lacks nutrition, care, and education.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our supportive care system is meant to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care means providing for all the needs they didn't have in their previous home.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and privileged access.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Aimee and McCord (1998) identified "personal connection" and "constant connection" as the new motivational visuals when researching audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions and facial movements, lasting for milliseconds.
Specifically, by correctly interpreting micro-clues, one can test whether a person is lying.
In his documentary The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks describes how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can accurately assess honesty.
He suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century revealed that there are two pools of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
While mutation adds new genetic variation, selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
With each generation the variation of disjunction and recombination shifts back and forth between the two reservoirs.
Outside the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to humans would find it difficult to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
And failure to do so has severe consequences: growth stress, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available sources of branches were the proteins found in leaves and beans, which primates like us would have a hard time digesting without cooking.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, shrimp, and eggs) provide high-quality proteins that contain all the essential amino acids, even though they are not easily digested.
All things considered, we should not be surprised to learn that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as the chimpanzees of the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the practice of deliberately staying awake during your normal sleep time and then falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done with a gentle alarm clock so that you can come to consciousness without being fully awake.
If your sleep clock is reset, it can be moved to the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluid (especially water or tea, known diuretics) before bed, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is opposite and related to the level of stress in a person's body and soul.
The lower the level of stress, the more positive the life-force will be. Everyone will be able to find complete peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of us achieving this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but draws heavily on the Mahayana path of love and the techniques of Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga awakens kundalini energy (source energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations. Kundalini yoga is a form of yoga in which the practitioner's body and mind are in a constant state of meditation.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the Goddess. Through the contemplation of the various deities the channels of energy flow are purified, the chakras are activated and liberation from consciousness is brought about.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. By the end of the war, clashes between systems, processes, and cultures had led to the separation of states.
Less than two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it was fought virtually by the armed forces, from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had collapsed, and the only hope was the reorganization of the retreating Romanian ring.
"However, these plans came to naught almost overnight when the Soviets invaded Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Non-Aggression Pact, the Riga Peace Treaty, and other international agreements, including bilateral and multilateral treaties, sending over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army to form the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts".
Ships are the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the role of seafarers is to enable the movement of people and goods in your country and, at the same time, prevent the movement of people and goods of your enemy.
One notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans sought to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to support Britain.
At the same time, German marines, supported mainly by U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have been able to conquer Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Historical cultures and tribes began keeping them as a convenient source of milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in wandering herds on the mountains or other grasslands, often tended by children or young adults, who were known as herders. These methods of care are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as far back as the 16th century.
Although wagon tracks consisted only of parallel planks, horses could pull them at higher speeds and carry heavier loads on rougher roads during the day.
Gradually, however, it was realized that it would be more efficient to put an iron bar on top of them.
This became a common practice, but the iron overloaded the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking, and with the rise of Homo erectus two million years ago, humans began to walk.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not habitually walk upright.
Although the coelanthropus may have been bipedal as early as seven million years ago, Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago show evidence of bipedalism.
We can start living more environmentally consciously, we can join the environmental movement, and become activists, and we can contribute to some extent in reducing future suffering.
However, if we do not want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems, and deactivate them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been compounded by population growth and a way of life that is out of proportion to man's.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a bill signed by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies of what is now known as the Dunlap Broadside were made overnight.
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his staff in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The earliest extant copy of the document is Dunlap Broadside 25, the original having been destroyed.
Most paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Because they have wings and can fly, most people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But there are still plenty of birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have scales and clawed feet, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T. Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary form.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these binary numbers are called digits - or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are common and may not be readily diagnosed.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is an open container of medicine or a toxic household chemical.
Check the label to see if there are any special first-aid instructions for the particular poison.
Entomologists use the word "mite" in a more formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from the bed bug, an insect that feeds on humans in the past.
Both deadly spiders and bed bugs are herbivores and have adapted to live in nests or their host's habitat.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and it is considered the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple can decide for themselves whether adoption would be in the best interests of the child or of them.
These couples may decide to have a family plan for their child.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights by allowing another couple to parent the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
But not only that, experimentation also comes into play, and while an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and observing also guides the scientific method.
Naturalists and philosophers turned to the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West became increasingly detached from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms of physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on the existence of endocrine cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, algae, and animals, have been documented to have a circadian rhythm that is not merely a response to external periodic cues.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators and will continue in a free-running cycle even without external cues.
Hershey and Chase's experiments were among the first to suggest that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used implants or viruses to insert their own DNA into the bacteria.
They performed two tests, either to mark the DNA of the eater with radioactive phosphorus or to mark the proteins of the eater with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the section of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cell is a germline cell.
Only mutations in the genome are passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who wish to visit natural areas, including flora and wildlife, for the purpose of enjoying the beautiful scenery.
Examples of in situ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans on Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small towns and villages in their cars to go to work, passing others who are working in the same place.
In this dynamic transportation cycle, everyone is connected in some way and supports a mode of transportation based on private cars.
This massive carbon economy has now, according to science, pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation, and almost everyone complains about transportation.
In developed countries, such complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges are rare.
Why are transportation systems so blamed, and why do they daily fail? Are transportation engineers so incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement and interaction of drivers and vehicles between two locations.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100 percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably constant range; thus, traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These contacts help in the planning, creation and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly enabled them to avoid predators more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their body.
This gives them a wider range to hide from predators.
So far, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are the rice weevil and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought that he was correct, but many disagreed; they thought that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, does it?
The Amazon is the world's second-longest and largest river. It carries eight times as much water as the next-largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, sometimes as much as six miles wide.
The Amazon receives 20 percent of the water that the earth's rivers discharge into the sea.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the size of the Giza pyramids and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were already a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of approximately 800. It is the smallest and least densely populated country in the world.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its constitution and official communications.
Italian was also the language of the common people, and Latin was widely used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Since gold, silver, and copper occur naturally in nature and can be mined relatively easily with primitive tools, humans have known about such basic chemical components since ancient times.
The philosopher Aristotle claimed that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This best corresponds to the four states of matter (in that order) being air, vapor, gas, and light, and at the same time, he theorized that it changes into the new elements we see.
An alloy is basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic components, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so amazingly small that there could be trillions of them in the period at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil was first introduced, it was a good companion for many people.
Sadly, as other forms of writing appeared, the pencil was relegated to a very inferior position and use.
Now, people type messages on computer screens without ever going near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle of energy resulting from the fusion of a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus again and releasing some of its energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no movement.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The near side is about 70 km thick and the far side is about 100 km thick.
It's thinner below the lunar plains and denser below the highlands.
Because the surface is thinner, there may be more tidal currents nearby, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Attraction theories are centered on finding out what people like or are attracted to.
These theories suggest that by adulthood people have internalized certain needs and/or desires.
These theories explore what motivates certain people to do what they do and how what they do or don't do is influenced by their surroundings.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum tries to be "one of the colleagues".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibility, and holding individuals accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, someone becomes an unknown who has a desire to change everything the group has ever done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This behavior often results in a rift between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Online teams share the same standard of excellence, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical team.
Because their teams can assemble in different time zones unknown to their local management, they often have more autonomy than a traditional team member.
The presence of a true "invisible group" (Larsen and LaFesto, 1989, p109) is another distinguishing characteristic of a virtual group.
The "invisible group" is the management group to which all members report. The invisible group sets the standards for each member.
Why does an organization need to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are used effectively across the functional areas of an organization.
As a result, the organization can move from a process of working together to overcome a barrier to a new process of innovation that serves the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and institutional learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Santhi approach as a way to reach a higher level of performance in an organization.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating consciousness. It therefore narrows the field of research and makes the research more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is helping scientists do their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury, and cancer, affect behavior and produce certain changes in mental function.
The rise of new technologies is allowing us to probe and see structures and processes in the brain in unprecedented ways.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although strongly associated with science fiction, artificial intelligence (AI) is an important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligence processing.
Research on AI is concerned with enabling machines to perform tasks requiring intelligence automatically.
Examples include the ability to respond to user errors and questions, as well as the control and design of handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become other disciplines, which focus on solving real-life problems.
AI is now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is built into several home computer and video game applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher likes to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or own beautiful masterpieces while sitting with the class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to share the experience of a field trip with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is redesigned, but older versions are kept online for use as a field book.
Blogs can also improve students' writing. Students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, and the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be intelligent about the world around them". Students need to be intelligent and interesting in order to present to the needs of the audience (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond a traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material, students can define their position within the context of others' writings and articulate their perspectives on particular issues" (Oreveke, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's beautiful bilingual capital, has an array of galleries and museums that span Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north is the scenic beauty of Muskoka and beyond that, the Nicollet.
All of these and more characterize Ontario, considered by outsiders to be one of the most important Canadian provinces.
Further north, the Great Lakes are sparsely populated, and some are uninhabited wilderness.
A demographic comparison that will surprise many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
Those East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of these, but in terms of wildlife, it's just a continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations or united with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Islam was brought to the Arabian Peninsula and became dominant in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century with the discovery of the Cape Route by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama to go from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
It is recommended that all female travellers identify themselves as married, regardless of their marital status.
And a ring (a very old-fashioned invisibility cloak also helps.
Women need to understand that cultural differences may account for what is perceived as harassment, and that following and grabbing are not uncommon.
Be more assertive in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Afna.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, rebuilt as Casa Branca, and abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badya, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts there renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in Morocco.
Although it is easy to find stalls selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and gigou spread throughout the area around the old medina, it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed the city of Goma, burying many of the city's streets, especially in the downtown area.
Although Goma is relatively safe, trips outside Goma should be researched to understand the nature of the conflict in North Kivu.
The town is the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and is one of the cheapest places in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
To get around Goma, you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis). The average (local) fare for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
With its relative difficulty of access, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for other, distant lands.
Timbuktu, once a tourist attraction with an airport, is now a poverty-stricken city.
Due to the threat of its desert sand, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990.
It was one of the main stops on the PBS special Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World.
Since the city has an Arabic rather than African flavor, it has an almost completely different character from other cities in the country.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
In almost all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entry fees for the park.
It would also be advantageous for one to purchase a Wildcard to access selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong Territory and is the main focus for many tourists.
Hong Kong's skyscrapers have been compared to a shimmering topographical feature visible from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite Kowloon Waterfront.
Much of the urban development on Hong Kong Island has been built on reclaimed land on the North Shore.
This is where the British colonists took possession as their own, and if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest marine mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline to the Bangladesh and Indian borders.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forest is not just mangrove swamps - it is also the remnant of the great forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which one third is covered by wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and is now estimated to be home to about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Especially buses heading east and towards Jakhar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30 but buses leave from the inter-district bus stand (across the river) throughout the day.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by comfortable and sturdy miniature Japanese coaster buses.
Shared taxis are quick and comfortable ways to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Pune (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge connecting the towns of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges-de-la-Oiapoque, French Guinea.
The two towers are 83 meters high and 3.50 meters wide. The two-lane bridge has a length of 378 meters.
The horizontal clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, although it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, the same time that Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco was home to indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies", came into being in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year is held on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year there are also mini-tournaments and competitions.
For news of tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British Pound (GBP).
Currency on the islands can be exchanged at the islands' only bank opposite the FIC West supermarket in Stanley.
While British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
British and U.S. currency is available on outlying islands, but credit cards may not be accepted; check with owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is not possible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so please exchange before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, in the northern hemisphere it is summer when it is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, where temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius are common during the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct seasons as "wet" and "dry": precipitation remains the same throughout the year.
Although animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from other wildlife.
As tame as they may seem, bison, scorpions, moose, bears and every other large animal are capable of attacking you on foot.
Each year, dozens of tourists are injured when they don't keep their distance. These animals are large, aggressive and often ferocious, so they must be given the space they need.
Additionally, remember that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and remember to keep the campground clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has fewer than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a fierce naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave port.
All but one British warship were sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly of the town ended with the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to its location between two harbours, Auckland has many beaches. The most popular are in three areas.
The coast of the North Sea (Northern Port District) is on the Pacific Ocean and extends from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost entirely sandy beaches with safe swimming, many of them shaded by paua trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the central Auckland suburbs of Mission Bay and St Helier's Millennium Market in the Waitemata Harbour.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with a good row of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not a complex beer but is fine and fresh. The other local beer is called "Manta".
Although many French wines are available, New Zealand and Australian wines are best suited to the trip.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid of it, bottled drinking water is easy to find.
Australians are unfamiliar with the concept of a 'single white' coffee. A short black coffee 'espresso' is a cappuccino topped with cream (not foam), while tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is made according to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is more expensive but exquisite.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from these causes on the reef are rare.
However, listen to the advice of all authorities, obey all signals, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appeared on the coasts and near estuaries between October and April 1770. Outside of these times they were rarely encountered.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, and their primary habitat is the tidal flats north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have somewhere to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Often travel agents have deals with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, arranging transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any amendments or requests should be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some events, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and many attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the show up close, you'll need to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Please be aware that although the music on the main stage has ended, some sections of the festival may continue to play music late into the night.
Some events have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin, because those most affected will hear a very loud noise when crossing the ice.
Passengers from St. Petersburg spend time in the cruise ship city. Cruise ship passengers do not need a visa (check the rules).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. They usually have no windows or clocks, and exit points are difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings to keep the guests in good spirits and keep them on the premises.
In some places alcoholic beverages are served, but while drunkenness dulls the senses, skilled gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at higher altitudes or on more mountainous roads needs to be aware of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
Ice and snow reduce friction, and you can't drive as smoothly as on asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a short period of time to lock you in.
Falling or blowing snow and condensation or ice on vehicle windows may limit visibility.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many countries, and traffic is often continuous throughout the year.
Safaris are Africa's greatest tourist attraction and are a highlight for many travelers.
In popular usage, a safari is an overland journey to view interesting African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to live close to cars and standard equipment allows good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
For a mobile safari (also called "bushwalking", "walking safari", or "walking") the walk may take several hours or several days.
The 2021 Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5. Some events will be held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having also hosted in 1964.
If you've pre-booked your flights and accommodation for 2020, you could be in trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies in late March do not extend beyond July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with an average of 7,000 yen.
Washing wet clothes helps them dry. Many hotels may temporarily ask for oysters and retainers, even if not in the room.
If you do not have a curling iron, or if you prefer not to wear knitted socks, you can use a hair dryer.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (it can shrink, or in extreme cases, wrinkle).
There are many different types of water purifiers, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, one minute is enough to conserve water; in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you may want to consider purchasing sealed water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause pain, or in extreme cases, allergies, spread toxins, or cause infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that force humans to injure or kill themselves, are not generally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the practice of purchasing goods that are exempt from certain local taxes and duties.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money on such products as alcohol and tobacco.
Driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, which passes through secluded forest land, there are dangerous driving conditions between Marion Point and Fairmount.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits in the fore and aft sections are significantly lower - typically 35-40 km/h (56-64 mph) - and otherwise even more important to comply with.
Curiously, cell service is stronger here than at most other points along the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are excellent, and in Bavaria, similar to those of their southern neighbour Austria, are very rich and varied.
With apple arrangements in pastries all year round, fruit pastries are plentiful, and cherries and plums are delicious in autumn.
Almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts can be found in many German baked goods. Popular cakes often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, look no further than Berliner, Funchhausen, or Krappen.
A stew is a meal of herbs and spices served with either meat or vegetables.
A consonant can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of solution.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is a common ingredient in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the peninsula, coconut milk is common.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term covering a wide variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualification, the term originally referred to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now common throughout the archipelago, contains a range of purely savoury dishes, the main seasonings of Javanese are peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Leg straps are the straps that support the rider's feet on the sides of the saddle.
They give the rider great stability, but can cause safety problems by trapping the rider's legs inside them.
If a rider falls off his horse and gets his leg caught in the stirrups, the horse may continue to run, pulling the rider along with it. To reduce this risk, some precautions can be taken.
First, most horsemen wear high-heeled boots with smooth, slightly narrow soles.
Next, especially in some English saddles, there are safety strips to help keep the leather straps from slipping off the saddle if the rider pulls back.
The Cochamo Valley is Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its massive walls and steep cliffs like those of Calugel.
Mountaintops offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly blazing new trails between its endless walls.
Alpine skiing, which includes snowshoeing and cross-country skiing, is a popular sport where you strap snowshoes or snowboards to your feet and ski down snow-covered terrain.
Snowboarding is a major tourist activity popular among snow sports enthusiasts, commonly known as "ski bums", who spend their entire vacation at a particular ski resort.
The concept of skiing is ancient - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 B.C.E.!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first ski club as a recreational activity was opened in Australia by Norwegians in 1861.
Backpack skiing: This is also known as ski touring or ski hiking.
It involves but does not usually refer to alpine-style snowboarding trips or mountaineering, the latter being done on sloped terrain and requiring more robust snowboarding equipment and boots.
Think of a trail of footprints in the snow.
In good conditions you will be able to cover more distance than walking, and you will rarely be able to achieve cross-country skiing speeds without large bumps on well-paved roads.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling to a number of countries means encountering visa application and passport control processes several times.
However, the Schengen area is to some extent a single country in this respect.
As long as you are in this zone, you will normally be able to cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas separately for each of the Schengen member states, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no common definition of what manufactured items are antiques. Items more than 100 years old are defined as antiques by some tax agents.
There are geographical variations to the definition, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, but they are less ancient than similar mass-produced goods.
Fishing is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture associated with this trade is also important for many other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sami were associated with large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer to pull loads.
Today, many Sami are involved in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income for the Sami region.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romanians, the term "gypsy" is often perceived negatively because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romanians.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might expect to get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
As one example, American travelers in the Middle East may encounter different difficulties than Europeans and Arabs.
Warnings are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
Often the ideas presented are haphazard, general, and simplistic, in contrast with the more detailed information found elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world in a variety of ways, depending on geographic location, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Thunderstorms, cyclones, tornadoes, and hurricanes as well as high winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of extreme weather.
Severe regional and seasonal climatic events include blizzards and severe blizzards, ice storms and dust storms.
