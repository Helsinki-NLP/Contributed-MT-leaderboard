Eemeli Kouki led the Hurricanes to a home victory in the opening game , the second win for Savo Volley .
Hurrikaani-Loimaa, who had won seven consecutive men's volleyball Champions League medals, started the 2018-19 season with a home win when Raision Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Returning to Finland from Romania, all-rounder Eemeli Kouki was the Hurricanes' most effective player with 22 points.
There were some plans for abroad, but they didn't come true, and then I got a call from Loima.
Hook said it didn't take them long to settle up.
Like Kouki, Tomi Rumpunen, who also played in Loimusa, supported Kouki with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the national team player Samuli Kaislasalo with 17 points.
It's always important to win the opener.
Many of the players had experience on the other side, too, and that added an extra element to the game.
MEPs in the committee also want to see a ban on the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
I 'm deciding Savo Volley as the most efficient
Miro Määttänen was Savo Volley's most effective player with 18 points, when the team defeated Vieremä Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our play was erratic, especially on the offensive end, but luckily we were able to squeeze out a win.
The Commission's proposals are based on the principle of subsidiarity, which means that it is up to the Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the rules of competition are observed.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Vieremä's Volleyball 3 series in the 2000-01 season, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was satisfied with many things.
It was a small hall, so the atmosphere was high all the time.
I got a good vibe from the open house.
Miro was king, Sillik played a good game too, Tuovinen said.
Siltalan's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielaveden Sammos with Tuovinen as head coach.
Thiago Maciel led the Ducks with 14 points.
Mikkonen is the star of Aka Volley again
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league points in the 2012-13 season, has started this season strongly.
Hakkuri scored 25 points as Akaa-Volley claimed their season opener by defeating the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
It's been a pretty good start to the season for you.
Today, of course, was a close call, as we were down 17-21 in the fourth.
We were digging for a tie, and round five just happened, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, when the Tigers were still in the playoffs, their best scorer was 28-point guard Edvarts Buivids.
Alexander Kudryachev, a fellow Russian, led the way with 17 points.
We didn't get much out of the guy's hack. Mikkonen said it was good.
Finland ranks first in the world in human capital comparison
Finland leads the world in human capital, reports the scientific journal Lancet.
This appropriation is intended to cover expenditure on studies, meetings of experts, information and publications directly linked to the achievement of the objective of the programme or measures coming under this article, and any other expenditure on technical and administrative assistance not involving public authority tasks outsourced by the Commission under ad hoc service contracts.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top five were almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Iceland, Denmark, Canada, and the Netherlands had followed Finland.
Later, the Netherlands was ranked one place higher, and Taiwan replaced Canada.
In 2016, the worst performers were Niger and South Sudan.
Human capital is measured by the educational attainment, access, skills and health of the population.
The World Bank has highlighted the link between human capital and economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois held Atletico to a goalless home game.
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois pulled off a brilliant save and the Madrid teams' home game ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish league.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but Belgian goalkeeper Courtois was intercepted.
Courtois played for Atlético for three seasons on loan while a Chelsea player.
Earlier this week, he was named Goalkeeper of the Year by FIFA, the international governing body of soccer.
In the end, Gareth Bale got the better of the opening goal, but his shot went wide at the end of the first half.
Bale has been substituted after the break with a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real Madrid supporters chanted the name of Juventus goalkeeper Cristiano Ronaldo during the match.
In the United States, the right to abortion is now under attack.
The United States Senate is currently considering whether to nominate President Donald Trump's nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, to be one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
Many in the Republican Party hope Kavanaugh's decisive vote will overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe tells the story of how the United States got to where it is today.
Incredible as it may seem, the subject is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has campaigned against safe abortion and has received varying degrees of support from the majority of MEPs.
The powerful documentary opens with an interview with gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has been left as the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri because of tightening laws.
An armed guard at the clinic says he's standing up for religious freedom in America.
The news footage is reminiscent of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Fast-forward to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, an association of Lutheran clergymen directed women to reliable abortionists.
The reasoning of the pastor interviewed is good, but actually it is not even needed, a photograph of a woman who died from a self-abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the U.S. last year.
The legalization of abortion was strongly supported by the Republican Party.
As early as 1967, California's abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his 1980 presidential campaign, who pioneered the blending of religion with politics to win votes.
His successor, George Bush Sr., also reversed his abortion stance.
And so did Donald Trump.
The documentary gets to the very heart of the matter as it searches for the root cause of the politicization of abortion.
When segregationist religious organizations were denied tax exemptions, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as the topic of conversation.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
At the time of writing, the US is in a situation where the president, who has boasted of sexual harassment but won the votes of the religious right with his pro-abortion stance, has nominated Kavanaugh, who many women now accuse of sexual harassment, for the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh could be given the power of veto to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot and killed seven Palestinians, including two children, during mass protests along the border.
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months of Israeli shelling of protesters in the border area.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Friday, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.
Among the dead are two children, aged 12 and 14, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been injured.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and carried out an airstrike on the border area after protesters hurled rocks and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says it has begun using force to prevent protesters from breaching the border fence or trying to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are 12,000 wounded.
The protesters are demanding that Palestinian families be allowed access to areas from which Palestinians were displaced when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed an Israeli soldier.
Explosive devices dropped by kites and helium balloons from the Palestinian side have set fire to forest and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Pukki got the penalty kick . He didn 't get to shoot himself .
Wigan's top scorer Chey Dunkley appeared to have taken him down with a tackle from behind in the box.
The referee, Gavin Ward, allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Pukki couldn't believe his eyes.
It seems that the referee, Ward, has been left to deal with the situation, awarding Norwich a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Santa went down.
Ward kicks a penalty, and Mario Vrancic scores the winning goal, 1-0.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The last one came last Saturday against QPR with a classy chest muscle.
Santa's got his work cut out for him again.
When he lost the ball, he kept going until the end.
He created scoring opportunities and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, it was their fifth game in two weeks.
The team will continue in the League Cup.
He's on a five-game winning streak.
The pedophile helpline was immediately filled with reservations - About 40,000 people in Finland are interested in children
It is estimated that 2 percent of males and a small percentage of females experience at least some sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 persons.
Until now, those who are sexually attracted to children or young people have found it difficult to get help.
SeriE, a joint project of the Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals to deal with paedophiles as clients and to help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, Sexpo, which offers counselling and therapy, was flooded with e-mails and appointments were booked very quickly, Yle reports.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Many are ashamed of their sexual preference for children.
The majority of those who recognize pedophilic feelings in themselves have not acted out their fantasies and thus have done nothing criminal.
A preference, however, is usually a permanent quality.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that harass and depress them.
They also make normal life difficult, says Patricia Thesleff, a sex therapist at Yale and a specialist on the project.
I think the work is worthwhile if even one child is spared from sexual violence, says Thesleff.
The leaders of the Koreas or a Congolese gynecologist?
US President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites for the prize based on betting odds.
In the background is Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least at the rhetorical level, to commit to denuclearization.
The odds favor South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and pledged to work toward a peace treaty.
The warming of relations between the two Koreas is remarkable, for as recently as last year relations were icy.
Still, rewarding Kim, who has wielded nuclear weapons for years and rules his country with an iron fist, would undoubtedly raise eyebrows.
The winners of the Nobel prizes will be announced from Monday, and on Friday the one that receives the most attention, the peace prize, will be announced.
If the prize is not awarded to those who have contributed to diplomacy on the Korean peninsula, one of the leading candidates is Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a respected gynecologist has treated thousands of victims of gang rape and has become the world's leading expert in his field.
Mukwege's work has drawn attention to sexual violence, a horrific by-product of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong contender.
The Nobel Committee has announced that there are 331 candidates for the prize this year.
The names of the candidates will not be released to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind winning the Nobel.
In May, at the White House, he was asked by a reporter if he thought he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Everybody thinks that, but I would never say that", Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
He also called on the Commission and the Member States to take the necessary steps to ensure that the EU's external borders are fully respected.
There are, however, a number of factors that make Trump's Nobel Prize unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the prize, has often recognized individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and a multipolar world order - the very kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as opposed to.
In the 21st century, three American politicians, all Democrats, have won the Nobel Peace Prize: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
So awarding the prize to Trump would require the Nobel committee to make an ideological U-turn.
We have a report of a fire in the tunnel, drivers behaved as agreed and drove the wrong way.
The traffic chaos on Route 1 in Lohja occurred on September 8.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in both the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system failure, the fire department attempted to restore normal traffic.
But it didn't happen very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Center said that it could not be opened because there are drivers on the road in shock and they drive as they please, the on-call fire chief Pasi Kääriäinen told STT.
In those days, people would even take the highway in the wrong direction after just a short delay.
When the first one starts acting against traffic rules, a few others often follow, marvels Tapio Heiskanen, traffic safety liaison officer.
Traffic regulations prohibit stopping on motorways and in tunnels unless absolutely necessary.
Transport safety reminds us that in exceptional situations we cannot risk traffic with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles shall at all times provide the greatest possible freedom of movement.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as are making a U-turn and reversing.
The same prohibitions apply in tunnels where, in addition, headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without a valid reason is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
Recently, there have even been cases of drivers stopping in tunnels to shovel snow from their cars.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and the wrong time for this activity, says Heiskanen.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue the party even if the boat was stuck at the bottom of the lake.
The Ilves fans, who were being transported to Tampere by the inland vessel M/S Tampere, would have liked to stay on board to continue their victory celebrations, even though the ship had stuck its bow to the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship's captain at the time of the incident.
Late Saturday night, the M/S Tampere, en route from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off course and ran aground with its bow in Vanajavesi in Akaja.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated overnight to the mainland.
No one was injured in the accident.
MEPs in the committee also want to see a ban on the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in animal feed.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3 victory for Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday's accident was caused by the fact that the water level in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest navigation mark was covered with seagull droppings, which meant that its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn sky.
No collision to speak of.
The accident occurred on the western side of the narrow Jumusensalmi strait shortly after the shipping lane had passed under the Tampere-Helsinki motorway bridge.
The Commission's proposal for a regulation on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 17 December.
According to the Norwegian authorities, the grounding has not caused any leakage or sinking of the vessel and it appears that the cruise operations are continuing normally.
On Saturday morning, a diver went to check on the condition of the ship before it was towed out of the shallows.
To be on the safe side, we still visit the shipyard to check that no damage has been caused", Syrjä explains.
Syrjä believes that the M/S Tampere's next cruise, booked for next weekend, can be arranged as agreed.
According to him, the cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
Not to be used for ambulances
Emergency services were alerted to the incident shortly after 11:30 Saturday night.
Ambulances were called to the port of Viiala to receive the evacuated passengers, but they were of no use.
Fire Chief Matti Willman said late last night that evacuation conditions at the lake were difficult due to darkness and fairly strong winds.
The Pirkanmaa rescue service announced after 2:30 a.m. on Sunday night that all on board had been evacuated and the passengers transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser was built in 1957 and renovated in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Accused of harassment and drinking, Trump's judicial nominee could lose top job
Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court, may well lose his coveted position, estimates Mika Aaltola, program director at the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior when they were students.
According to Aalto, the doubts have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up nominating someone else.
Occasionally in the United States, a presidential nominee for the Supreme Court has stirred up considerable controversy.
In this case, the judge candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
It's how the president's been able to save face.
The nomination would go to the Democratic caucus.
The Supreme Court of the United States tends to be above politics, but at least in the case of Judge Kavanaugh, the selection of a new justice has become a very politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is nominated, Aalto says the decision will likely go to the Democratic caucus in the upcoming midterm elections.
It would increase voter turnout among young people and women, who would be more likely to vote Democrat.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative justice to the Supreme Court would be a long-term win for Republicans.
In the United States, Supreme Court justices are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have voluntarily retired in their 70s or 80s.
Even some Republicans are having second thoughts about the nomination.
A background check is normally carried out on candidates for the US Supreme Court, Aaltola says.
Although Trump has given the FBI only a week to complete its investigation, Aalto says it could still turn up something substantial.
Yes, it might.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
Aalto says the one thing that is certain is that Kavanaugh's fitness or unfitness for office will be hotly debated before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are believed to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be if the nomination went to a vote and the Republicans lost.
A woman identified the Salisbury suspect as a military intelligence agent.
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she has identified the Russian man suspected of the Salisbury poisonings as an agent of Russian military intelligence.
Based on the photographs, she identified the man as Anatoli Chepiga, a military intelligence officer with the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported earlier that they had identified one of the men suspected of poisoning as Chepiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men's current identities were covers.
A BBC team traveled to the Far East near the Russian-Chinese border to visit the village where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman from the village identified young Tshepigan from photos published by Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man from British police photographs of a man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
The Russians are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Novichok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals made it out alive.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded with, among others, the Hero of Russia title in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspected GRU connection.
Earlier in September, the men suspected of the poisonings told Russian television that they had been in Salisbury as tourists.
Elderly people as scapegoats for social reform
Now we have a living example of what the change limit of the social security reform defined by the Sipilä government means in practice.
The health services in my home municipality of Vaala are provided by the Oulunkaari Municipality Association, whose health services manager is the former regional director of Attendo, elected in 2016.
The leaders of the association of municipalities warn the council about the change limiter.
If military spending increases now, state aid to the municipality will be cut in the future.
Municipal decision-makers were alarmed, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of the care of the elderly, which would eliminate the inpatient ward of the health center and the small memory unit.
Home health care would be expanded, which in long-distance Valais means uprooting the elderly from remote villages and placing them next to a health centre for "home" care.
Attendo relied on the municipality to pay for its customers.
The Left did not swallow the poor preparation, but organised a good public event, which was attended by many relatives, carers and also councillors from other parties.
On the slides I showed how the municipality of Vaala already provides the best care for the elderly at home in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, a councillor from the neighbouring municipality, was also present.
The local newspaper did a big story on the occasion, and that in turn put the Oulu Arch builders on their feet.
Sote-makers do not write on any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home for Vaala, which is now empty and waiting for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The manufacturers only talk about the service voucher, but do not say what level of care it provides or what staff structure Attendo will have to take care of the elderly until they enter hospice care.
Without a nurse?
The health centre is being closed down because there is no doctor on duty at night.
Attendo will also rely on doctors from the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the whale shows how central officials run the councillors with insufficient information and the councillors are put against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Centre Party is emptying Vaala of its inhabitants, because who will remain there without security to live there voluntarily if they have the opportunity to move away.
Was one of the campaign slogans of the Centre that the whole country should be kept populated?
Turkish President Erdogan inaugurated the Grand Mosque in Cologne
In Cologne, Germany, thousands protested the opening of one of Europe's largest mosques by visiting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Rhine as early as this morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, protesters held signs and chanted slogans condemning fascism.
There have been several demonstrations and tight security during Erdogan's visit, which began on Thursday.
In Cologne, some 10 000 people were expected to take to the streets to protest, among other things, against the human rights situation in Turkey.
Erdogan's supporters had also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had cordoned off a large area around the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Mr Erdoğan praised the success of his visit to Germany, which he said had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdoğan met twice with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild their countries' relations, which have deteriorated significantly since the 2016 Turkish coup attempt.
However, she emphasised that there were profound differences between the two countries on issues such as human rights.
Criticism Surrounds the Visit
Both the Mayor of Cologne, Henriette Reker, and the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, cancelled their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said she had come to the anti-Erdogan demonstration from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot take to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his way of thinking is terrorism.
In the final stage of Erdogan's visit to Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia has a significant population of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three men have been charged with the murder of a journalist.
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said Friday that three people are charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in a murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
In February, Kuciak and his fiancée were found shot to death in their home in Bratislava.
He'd been investigating the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police suspect the murders are related to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of Karelian on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to a printing error, the Sunday Karelian will also have to be mailed without an address.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas, where distribution to public mailboxes has to be done from memory.
It was the same with Saturday's newspaper, and the problem may continue into Monday.
The post office is putting extra bundles of newspapers in the county.
Newspapers for subscribers in the rest of Finland are posted separately only on Mondays with a sticker.
There will be a considerable delay in the distribution of these magazines.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut.
Arto Nyberg will be interviewing Vesa Heilala today on his live talk show.
Vesa is here in the studio to talk about his upcoming space trip, which he booked on Virgin Galactic back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, for which a bank loan was needed.
If the original plans had been correct, Vesa would have been in space long ago.
However, the launch date has been postponed year after year.
Now, it seems that after an unfortunate and deadly test flight in 2014, things are looking up.
If all goes well, commercial flights will begin later this year or next year at the latest.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which puts her journey about a year after the first departure.
MEPs in the committee are calling on the Commission and the Member States to take the necessary steps to ensure that the directive is implemented as soon as possible.
At the same address, he also chronicles his yearning for space.
When I was a kid, I used to read a comic book called Star Trek and watch Star Trek on TV.
I've seen Star Wars, and that's what stuck with me.
Why wouldn't I be?
Everybody has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh host .
Manchester City continued their unbeaten run in the Premier League as they were beaten 2-0 at home to Brighton on Saturday.
The reigning champions secured their sixth win of the season with goals from Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling had his fourth shot of the season from close range into an empty net when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute from the Brighton goal post.
Aguero raised his own tally to five as he and Sterling sawed through Brighton's defence in the 65th minute.
The Argentine went on to score 2-0 from the penalty spot with ease.
Having started the season with six wins and one draw, City lead the Premier League with 19 points.
However, with one game less to play, Liverpool are only one point behind.
Liverpool face third-placed Chelsea in their seventh round tie on Saturday night.
Youth associations elected new decision-makers in Joensuu
In its meeting that ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Association elected new decision-makers for its next three-year term from 2019 to 2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savon was elected Chair and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme was elected Vice-Chair.
40 full members and 40 deputy members were elected to the council, the Finnish Youth Association announced on Sunday.
A youth club meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for their quality and safety.
In its three-year action objectives, the Youth Association Meeting held in Joensuu makes three promises: We will keep our doors open to everyone, and we will organize equal recreational activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we will support volunteer activities and people on their own growth paths, Finnish Youth Associations says in a press release.
Lewis Hamilton was full of praise for Kimi Raikkonen.
In an interview with Swiss newspaper Blick, the Mercedes driver was asked if he believed that releasing Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton for the rest of the season.
Hamilton has a 40-point lead over Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in the world championship points standings.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen will not continue with the team next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced his move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, doesn't think that Rumplestiltskin is going to go for it.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He is an exceptional professional, a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari is losing a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreaming of Formula One, I used to play F1 on the PlayStation all day.
"I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy", Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season resumes on Sunday with the Russian Grand Prix.
Starting from pole position at 1400, the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas.
Tonight's edition will follow the race minute by minute.
The championship match of the Football A-Youth SM League became a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The boys' soccer championship will conclude on Saturday with the final round of the season.
Before the round that started at 1 pm, the starting points for the championship match were clear: FC Lahti Akademia was enough for first place, practically a point against Vasa IFK.
In order to turn things around in the final round, second in the championship, Ilves must win PK-35 and hope the Lakers lose.
However, the championship of Lahti was practically confirmed even before the opening whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less vassal, the match could not have begun.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At halftime, the Lakers led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the Vaasa players' loss is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-youth SM-league or P20-league and the men's Second C-block.
Vasa IFK has played in the Second Division practically all season against falling.
In the second final round on Saturday, Vasa IFK has to beat JBK in the away match and at the same time hope that Tampere United loses their own away match against KuF in Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on the roof of a building in Eno . Emergency responders say it was a lucky break .
A passenger car went off the road and ended up on a roof in Eno on Juttuvaarantie around 9am on Sunday.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, according to the emergency services.
"Luck was on our side", says the press release.
Emergency services said the road was wet from the rain.
A police patrol went to the accident site.
Supo is waiting for new means of intelligence: Equipment purchases and recruitments already made, no word about planned activities abroad
According to Supo chief Antti Pelttari, preparations for the Intelligence Act have been made by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
When the intelligence laws come into force, the SOPO budget will be permanently increased by some EUR 10 million.
In the offices of the Security Police (Supo) on Ratakatu in Helsinki, preparations for the entry into force of the intelligence laws are already in full swing.
Supo's military commander Antti Pelttari tells Western Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams shocked the world with a video of her singing topless in support of breast cancer awareness.
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is on the rise again.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account in which she sings simply with her hands in front of her breasts, reports AFP.
The song is a cover of the 1991 hit "I Touch Myself" by Australian band The Divinyls.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Foundation.
"Recorded The Divinyls worldwide hit to remind women to do regular self [breast] checks", Williams wrote on Instagram.
And yes, this put me in an uncomfortable position, but I wanted to do it because it's an issue that affects women of all colors around the world.
Early detection is the key - it saves many lives.
The Divinyls' song was co-written by Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, created in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She died of breast cancer, but she gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first", says Williams.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
In the comments section of the video, Williams is praised for her bravery.
Williams withdrew earlier this week from the Beijing tennis tournament.
The background is the uproar at the U.S. Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams lashed out at the referee, claiming, among other things, that much more aggressive behavior is accepted from men than from women players.
The Chinese restaurant on the mountain trail is not for the faint of heart.
In addition to traditional Chinese dishes, the restaurant offers spectacular scenery.
An extraordinary restaurant has opened in the Zhejiang province of China.
It's literally on the edge of a cliff.
If you want to, you can look out over the forest below.
The rugged scenery in the high altitudes makes diners gasp for breath in the Longquan Mountains.
To get to the restaurant, you have to hike through the peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers on September 19, 2018.
I've seen comments on YouTube asking where the restaurant bathroom is.
A hike to the restaurant requires a good foundation, the site explains.
The Korpela Alley Run ends today, and this is how it all ends.
All good things must come to an end.
Tonight, that's what happens to the domestic rural drama Raven's Run, which has been quite popular.
The third series has been a huge success, with 722,000 Finns watching its television premiere last week.
The peak figures themselves no longer have any practical significance, as there is no sequel to the series of Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen.
In the final episode, the relationship between Jaska and Mirku takes another real leap forward, and Jaska's mother seems to be the first to guess what is to come.
The relationship between Ansi and Miisa is also warm, even romantic in light of recent events, but then Skinny appears once again.
Even the police are suspicious of the man behind the curtain.
Still, none of you can predict Skinny's fate.
Anita, on the other hand, is about to hear some incredible news.
The last will of the Kaukon is revealed, bringing the woman to tears.
A week from Sunday night, we'll be back with new episodes of Sorjonen.
The Korpela Alley Run is on TV1 tonight at 21.05.
Do you think it's a good idea to go to work tomorrow with a little cold?
Here are the facts for and against.
Flu season's in full swing.
A lot of people are deciding whether or not to stay home.
However, the worker should consider whether it is worth infecting others, since the disease can be contagious even if his symptoms are mild.
Sometimes flu symptoms come on suddenly, sometimes they creep up on you.
In the latter case, even if your symptoms seem mild, you may already be infecting others, reports Prevention.
So you think it's a good idea for me to stay home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when a person has no symptoms.
The virus is contagious from a day before symptoms appear to five days to a week afterward.
Children may be contagious for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or work.
You can return to work when the coughing stops and the fever is gone, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
Exercise should also be avoided.
Going back to the gym too soon will slow down your recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, wipe your nose with a tissue, and dispose of your toilet paper in the trash.
Sick to the bone, though?
If you must leave home when sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask doesn't keep viruses at bay, but it does keep the wearer aware of the head area.
Then no fingers should be put in the nose or mouth, Poland says.
Sneezing is also restricted to the mask.
How, then, can infection be avoided?
The best practice is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
The latter, however, is difficult to avoid.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches his eyes, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, warns Poland.
The new Miss Finland repeats the Miss tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
A hockey player and a beauty queen are often lumped together.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
Miss Finland 2018 has been crowned by Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
The beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is Ingrian-Finnish and her father is Russian.
Voronkova was bullied at school because her father was Russian.
My parents moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied for being Russian.
In Perth, I had no friends at all, Alina says at the announcement of the semi-finalists of the Miss Finland competition.
After high school, Alina decided to start fresh and move to Lahti to attend high school.
Soon Miss Beauty found new friends, and life got back to normal.
That's when you're 15 and you think you're an adult, but looking back, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Jonas Hurr, who is known from the Pelicans.
After the SM-liiga career, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was part of the Finnish team at the Under-18 World Championships.
In the early days of their relationship, the couple lived almost a year in a long-distance relationship, but later Alina got to travel the world with her husband.
If I were to be one of the three finalists and my career were to take off, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, we have a good relationship based on trust, and the good thing about a long-distance relationship is that the initial spark stays on all the time", grinned Alina in May.

Almost everyone is concerned about the earth's sustainability.
And yet there's almost nothing you want to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to continuous growth are being sought, but even the theory of economic austerity faces major problems.
Within a few generations, sustained economic growth has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living previously only dreamed of.
However, the long-term overshoot of the planet's carrying capacity and climate change threaten to destabilise this cornerstone of the market economy.
Two men were stabbed on the night before Sunday at the Sitrator Deck at 4 a.m.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing and another, born in 1968, was slightly injured.
The older man has already been released from the hospital.
Police have arrested one person in connection with the stabbing.
Police are also looking for a second suspect in connection with the events.
The incident is being investigated as attempted murder and aggravated assault.
An important point for IFK Mariehamn - the Inter coach regretted the mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt's equaliser against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt tied the game at 1-1 in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt got through from the right wing and picked up the ball, fortunately, over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
In the away game, the Marihamn team extended the gap to the Turku Palloseura to two points.
An important goal and a valuable point, summed up Maarianhamina's head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg noted, however, that the team did not put up the kind of fight he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening period, but luckily the Turku goal brought us stronger into the game.
John Allen, the head coach of the home team Inter, said the game was under control, but the goal was painful again.
One mistake on defense cost us the whole score. Allen was upset.
Once again, we were the best!

Lehterä has shown that he is outnumbered. The game is not yet decided.
Jori Lehterä's strong underdog play came to the fore as his NHL team, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their final preseason game.
Philadelphia beat Boston four to one, and Lehterara passed Michael Raffl twice for a touchdown.
For the past few days, Lehter has been in the spotlight on suspicion of drugs.
MTV reported on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a drug ring, where some are suspected of using drugs and some, for example, of selling them.
The paper has denied any wrongdoing.
The club and the player have discussed the matter, and the NHL is investigating.
After the game, Sam Carchidi, a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer who follows the Flyers closely, estimated that Lehter was among a group of six forwards, five of whom would make the NHL team.
In the training match Lehterä was, according to Carchid, excellent.
In the second round, Lehterä fought the puck to himself with inferior strength, pulled the defender against him and fed Raffl, who was waiting in front of the goal, into the open space.
Another time, the two of them teamed up to score late in the game.
The Flyers open their NHL season on October 4th with a road game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenceman Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching staff to decide if he can join an NHL team.
I thought training camp was good.
I did the best I could, and I can be proud of that.
Now it's up to the coaches to decide if I get to play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL, Vaakanainen said in an interview published on Boston's Twitter account.
Vaakanainen, who learned his hockey from the riverboys, played 7:31 against Philadelphia.
In the Boston goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and struck out 20 times.
Kärpät-backed defender Vili Saarijärvi scored for Detroit with a 1-0 lead as the team defeated Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary's lineup, Ilves grew up, defender Juuso Välimäki got a passing score, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
The Oilers rested Jesse Puljujärvi and goalie Mikko Koski, among others.
Florida's Aleksander Barkov played just over 20 minutes and scored a goal in a home game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defender Markus Nutivaara scored a consolation goal for his team midway through the final period as Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
In the losers' goal, Joonas Korpisalo stopped 23 of 27 shots.
We 've already had over 180,000 responses to the " What Time Is It ? "
Citizens have responded actively to the questionnaire concerning the decision on Finland's future.
The question of whether Finland should permanently apply wintertime or summertime has already attracted more than 180 000 replies.
The survey on the Otakantaa.fi service will remain open for a few more weeks.
Respondents are also asked whether they think Finland should be on the same time as the other Nordic, Baltic, Central European or Western Russian countries.
A recent picture shows the change: The world's strongest man lost dozens of pounds
Eddie Hall, crowned the World's Strongest Man in 2017, is undergoing a remarkable transformation.
Britain's Eddie Hall chased the title of world's strongest man for a long, determined time.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 calories a day and weighed 400 pounds [200 kg] at his peak, according to the Mirror.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted to doing damage to his body.
The human body wasn't meant to be this size, Hall said.
The Briton was desperate to win the World's Strongest Man competition, and the family man promised to end his career if he won the title.
Hall didn't want his kids growing up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was not seen again at the 2018 World's Strongest Man competition in April.
Recently, Hall posted a photo on Instagram in which he poses significantly thinner than his active career.
Hall writes that he now weighs 350 pounds.
Hall wrote that he now trains aerobically five times a week.
The program includes such activities as boxing, cycling, and swimming.
In addition, Hall works out four times a week at the gym.
This year, the world's strongest man was Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, an Icelandic weightlifter known from the TV series Game of Thrones.
The previous Finnish winner of the contest is Janne Virtanen, who was first in 2000.
The restaurant ship M/S Tampere has run aground on Lake Pyhäjärvi.
The inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere ran aground late on Friday evening on Lake Pyhä.
Emergency services received a report of a boating accident just after 11:30 Friday night.
The 100-foot [30 m] vessel M/S Tampere has run aground and is firmly attached to the rocks at the bow, said Matti Willman, the on-call fire chief.
The ship was carrying 19 passengers and five crew members.
Emergency services said there were no injuries.
The passengers and almost all of the crew have been evacuated to the mainland off the ship.
Now they are being transferred by bus to Tampere, said duty chief Jari Nieminen to STT after one o'clock at night.
Ambulances were called to the port of Viiala to receive the evacuated passengers.
For some reason, a ship traveling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off course on the western side of the narrow Jumusensalmen strait.
Police are investigating the cause of the incident.
Acting fire chief Matti Willman said earlier this evening that conditions on the lake were difficult due to darkness and fairly strong winds.
Rescue officials say the fate of the vessel is uncertain.
The ship doesn't seem to be leaking.
After the evacuation, the divers check the situation on the seabed.
Built in 1957, the M/S Tampere is now a restaurant ship with a maximum capacity of 180 passengers.
There is also a meeting room for private use.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser was restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers are suing Robert Helenius for unpaid fees.
The boxer Robert Helenius is shadowing the money men at tonight's fight against Erkan Teper.
Ilta-Sanomat reports today that boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and deputy referee Jussi Kokkila have filed a challenge in which Helenius is charged with unpaid manager fees totalling more than 80,000 euros.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius from 15 April 2014 to 30 January 2015.
We've tried to mediate, but there's no other choice.
MEPs in the committee also want to see a ban on the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
Helenius' current manager Markus Sundman sent a reply to Iltalehti, which tells the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the sum demanded.
According to the defendant, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a difficult financial situation and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius would be obligated to pay commissions only as a percentage of his fights.
They repeatedly assured Helenius that he would not have to pay anything, only receive the income they arranged.
This is also the normal and only practice in the management of professional athletes.
The Commission's proposals for the future of the Structural Funds, he said, should be seen in the context of the Lisbon strategy.
There was never a written agreement to cooperate.
According to the defendant, Helenius had wanted to agree on revenue sharing in writing from the outset, but Kokkila and Sundman only produced a draft at the end of 2014.
For his part, he considered the proposal to be poor and broke off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius didn't fight once in all his dealings with Kokkila and Pearl.
One year after the termination of the cooperation, Helenius had received an 'unidentified but substantial' invoice for the manager's work.
There's been a lawsuit filed this year with the same allegations.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkila's subsequent actions to be cowardly, the reply states.
Today, Helenius will face the seventh-ranked contender in the IBF heavyweight division Erkan Teper in Stuttgart.
He 's a warmhearted man and a good reporter .
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Long-time radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 from incurable liver cancer.
The announcement of the presenter's death was published on Sunday in Helsingin Sanomat.
According to the notice, Palli died on September 3.
Pälli announced his serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
At that time, the publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened to learn of the fate of an acquaintance.
He had already left a kind of farewell on Facebook, says Ile Vainio.
Vainio considers Erkki Pall a multi-talented person who became a great journalist.
He remembers that Päll was a popular person with quick wits and funny stories.
I got to know Erk when I was a little boy, when I first went to Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouseman.
That's when Erkki and I met.
At the time, he was Finnlevys spokesperson and held various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I started making records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions when Erkki Pälli was a regular journalist at all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable, and I could see how passionate he was about entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got right into their skin.
He was a warm man and a good reporter.
He was known to many as a respected radio host at Yale, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper articles.
Erkki interviewed me many times too.
He was a good talker. Vainio praises him.
Over the decades, Pälli worked as a journalist as well as in the Fazer record company with Toivo Kärki.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loiri's albums.
Päll's greatest passion, however, was radio work, in which he had an original style.
He worked in radio since the 1960s, and he became known to numerous listeners on Yle.
He retired in '98.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the association's financial year ended in May showed a profit of about 450 000 euros.
The association describes its economic situation as having undergone a "turnaround", although it admits that the economy is burdened by a "significant debt on the balance sheet".
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises the rapid response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation last autumn as quickly as possible by introducing adjustment measures.
Careful planning of operations and financial management has been ingrained throughout our entire organization, Kulmala says in a press release.
We have also been very successful in acquiring partners, and last year's World Cups were a great success.
Nevertheless, we must continue to keep a close eye on costs and at the same time constantly seek new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of a hospital in the town of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from an area where injured survivors are gathered for assessment of their injuries and need for treatment.
Patients are also being treated outdoors for aftershocks.
Baharuddin, a 52-year-old migrant worker, was searching for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
I last spoke to him when he was going to school", Baharuddin told AFP.
In the courtyard of the military hospital in Palu, Dwi Haris lay with injuries to his back and arm.
He was at a local hotel with his wife and daughter when the quake struck.
The family was invited to the Return wedding feast.
I was probably crushed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what's happened to her. I don't know what's happened to my baby.
I hope they're safe", Harris told the Associated Press, according to British media.
Small shops are being looted
At the evacuation center in Palu, Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of a small baby, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the mood in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many residents of Palu have been sleeping outdoors or in makeshift bamboo huts.
Even if a home is still standing, aftershocks could permanently destroy it and bury its occupants.
According to the Associated Press, more than half of the inmates at the prison in Palu escaped after the walls of the prison collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
Some inmates at Donggala Prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, inmates became angry and set the prison on fire after guards forbade them to search for relatives who had been affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Please, the airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first to land was an army C-130 transport plane carrying relief supplies.
Commercial flights to and from Palu will be permitted on a limited basis.
Pilots are forced to land at the airport without the help of air traffic control because the control tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
Rain sweeps across Finland at night
According to the National Weather Service, a large area of rain will spread across the country from the west overnight into Sunday.
Rain will mostly be in the form of water, but sleet or snow is expected in central and northern Lapland.
The bitterly cold temperatures of the previous night are not repeated, as temperatures remain higher under the cloud cover.
A cloudier night keeps the low temperatures in check quite effectively.
In the far west, it can be freezing for a while, said Ville Ilkka, a meteorologist on duty.
On Sunday, the rain zone will shift eastward as the morning progresses.
In the south and west, it's either marshy or partly cloudy.
In the afternoon, the temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees all the way up to Oulu.
The coming week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather is becoming more unstable.
High winds and tidal waves are in effect for coastal areas.
No major storms are expected for the next few days, but other than that, it's going to be typical autumn weather.
Ilkka said that the autumn will really start now.
Miss Finland finals are not televised.
IL-TV brings you the glamour and glamour of the Miss Finland red carpet.
Iltalehden's entertainment reporters are broadcasting live on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland final in Billnäs.
The broadcast will begin at approximately 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday among the ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held at the Billnäs pot in Raasepori.
Before the start of the final, you'll be able to watch the atmosphere live on IL-TV.
The live broadcast will begin at approximately 6:30 p.m. and will continue for approximately one hour.
This year, a particularly large number of Miss Finland winners from previous years have been invited to the final.
They will be represented on the jury by Miss Finland 1998, Jonna Ziprus.
Other members of the jury include well-being entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen, CEO of Jounin Kauppa, and Katja Lintunen, news producer at Seiska.
We were hoping she 'd get into college before she went to Miss America .
Russian father Dimitri and Ingrian mother Svetlana believed in their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, parents of the newly crowned Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, watched with pride as their daughter took the crown for the first time.
They told the audience that they were leaving Perth and that they were going to drive home after the final.
It's a great atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result, we got nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is Ingrian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana explains that as a child, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than in being a beauty queen.
Alina was often told that since she was so pretty, she should become a Miss.
But he announced that he wanted to be a radio host.
It wasn't until later that Alina became interested in beauty pageants.
Her parents hoped that Alina would go to university before competing in the Miss Finland contest.
This was the case, and eventually Alina wanted to get a nursing degree before competing in the Miss World contest.
We asked him last year why he wasn't doing it, but he wanted to finish the neighborhood.
Her parents believe that Alina won the contest because she sets a healthy example for young people and adults alike.
He exercises a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be in the spotlight, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri plays ice hockey professionally in Japan, and was not able to come to Finland to cheer on his beloved in the final.
Alina's parents believe that a young couple's relationship will last a mission year.
It's meant to be!
Her parents hoped that she would be able to visit them soon.
It's been such a long hiatus between visits because of Miss Congeniality.
I miss you already, even though I've left you messages.
A young man has been killed in a hit-and-run in Lahti . Police have arrested three people .
Police say three people have been arrested in connection with the incident.
On Saturday, Häme police did not comment on the course of events or the possible deliberate overtaking, citing the incompleteness of the investigation.
Police also declined to comment on whether those arrested and the man killed in the hit-and-run knew each other.
Further details of the case will be available early next week at the earliest.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels to become a stay-at-home mother in Finland - the idea for the comic strip came to her mind: her lack of drawing skills did not slow her down
"The idea for 'Organic Stuff' came from my husband, who suggested it as a character in a story I was developing", says Sari Piippo, a cartoon blogger, housewife and former EU translator from Espoo.
Sari Piippo explains that she worked in Brussels as an EU translator for economic and legal affairs until, after the birth of her fourth child, the family moved back ten years ago.
I've enjoyed being a stay-at-home mom very much.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I started thinking, "What am I gonna do when I grow up?"
Then, in 2014, a comic book came into the picture.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix since he was little.
I hadn't drawn since I was a kid, but when these "Creature Comforts" scripts started coming out, things changed.
When I first started, I put a few dozen scripts in a desk drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (born 2000) is a talented drawer, but I did not get her involved until the summer of 2016, when I donated Viivi with a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted about a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying himself, laughs Piippo, who says that the drawing board was a great encouragement to him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
Scripts pop into my head all the time, but I usually don't finish them all at once.
It can take up to several hours to produce a single three-screen strip.
I might do one screen at a time, and I like to play with colors.
Starting to draw is always the hardest, because drawing is not my strong point.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates current newspaper comics, such as Scott Adams' Dilbert.
The more organic characters are the L-themed, carrot-bodied mother with the lettuce hairdo.
The other characters are Man, Piss and Gemini.
In a more organic world, you are what you eat.
The ideas for the show come from my own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't like to preach or offer a hard time, even though she sometimes interferes with Organic Stuff.
Piippo says she reads her series with her husband and children.
I mean, it's such a great feeling when you look at a comic you've drawn and say, "This is what I did today".
And there are plenty of challenges for a stay-at-home mom!
The series can be read online at www.komikkuvablogit.com
The lottery 's million-dollar jackpot was left to swell - these were the right numbers
There were no draws in round 39/2018 of the Lotto.
The biggest winnings of the evening were seen in Saturday's Joker, which brought 20,000 euros to Vantaa and Vaasa.
Next week's Lotto will have 3.6 million euros in the pot.
I got two sixes on Saturday's Joker.
The second prize of 20,000 euros is a trip to Vantaa S-Market in Tikkurila for the winner who played with the Veikkaus card.
One was grabbed by a Vasal online player.
Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrifices himself, won't leave cracked tower until hundreds of passengers are safe
The hero of the Indonesian earthquake is 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung.
Agung remained alone in the control tower until he was able to escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people safely off the earthquake-shaken island.
The young man was on duty at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
While others fled from the control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat until he was able to guide the Batik Air passenger plane off the runway and into the air.
He may thus have saved hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation authority told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower was shaking and cracking.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
He broke his leg and sustained severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was scheduled to be transported by helicopter to a better-equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation official told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify after takeoff, eventually reaching a magnitude of 7.5.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
Indonesia's aviation authority has honored Agung's heroism on social media.
MEPs in the committee are calling on the Commission and the Council to take the necessary steps to ensure that the EU's trade policy is consistent with WTO rules.
The trade war between the U.S. and China will have repercussions for the entire global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth forecasts.
In his opening speech, Commission President Olli Rehn said that while heightened tensions would not have a direct impact on European trade flows, they would weaken confidence, which would be reflected in investment decisions by companies.
This also applies to exports by Finnish companies.
He also called on the Commission and the Member States to take the necessary steps to ensure that the EU's external borders are fully respected.
It has succeeded in building peace with the United States and has also contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan.
He also stressed the need for the EU to play a more active role in promoting democracy and human rights.
You have to look at the next tweet and judge from there.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in Washington, but he did say that in the Yale interview.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area and one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the western world.
The markets reacted sharply yesterday to the Italian government's presentation of a clearly deficit budget on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit will be more than 2.4% of GDP.
MEPs in the committee are calling on the Commission and the Member States to take the necessary steps to ensure that the directive is implemented as soon as possible.
Five per cent of the country's outstanding loans are non-performing and more than 10 per cent are non-performing.
Moreover, its public finances are weak and it appears to be once again over-committing itself vis-à-vis its European partners.
MEPs in the committee also want to see a ban on the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
The second challenge facing Europe is Britain's departure from the EU.
Mr Rehn hoped that it would be accepted.
A contentious divorce would have far more negative effects.
Mr Rehn took up his duties as Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will step down in just over a year.
Discussions for his successor have begun.
Both Rehn's name and that of his predecessor Erkki Liikanen have been mentioned.

HS's super-popular Black Box performances will continue next week with the last tickets to Helsinki on sale.
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue next week.
Other performances will take place at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
23 October The Black Box visits the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets available for the National Theatre.
The show in Tampere is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers will take the stage to tell a true story they have been preparing for a long time and which has never been published before in any HS media.
Once again, there's something that I'm sure no one's ever heard before.
"There is a strange spy in the Helsinki night, an impressive report from the other side of the globe and a touching story about a very topical health issue", says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organising live journalism evenings for three years.
Since their inception, they have been popular and often sold out.
Over 15,000 people have already visited the auditorium.
The black box was honored at the Bonnier Awards for journalistic achievement of the year.
The winners praised the new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to get closer to their readers.
In the spring season of 2019, Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The content of the performance will be different from that of this autumn's evenings.
Missing mushroom picker found by "unprecedented experiment"
The Finnish police's drone expertise is the best in the world: "People ask us about training"
According to the director of the police academy, the police can use the drone not only to search for missing persons but also for crime scene investigation and intelligence gathering.
Oulu police managed on Tuesday to find a missing mushroom picker in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, principal of the police college, tweeted about the incident and mentioned, among other things, that "through unprecedented experimentation and effective training, we are also the world's top in this field".
Drones are a relatively new piece of equipment, and even newer to police work.
There are no statistics showing that the Finnish police are masters at using drones.
According to Himberg, there is a strong feeling that this is the case.
This has become clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is tremendous interest in it elsewhere, says Himberg.
It would be hard to force visitors to watch Finnish police drone activity.
We're being asked for training.
It's getting more common.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work is based on Article 100a of the Treaty.
As noted, in the case of Raah, the drone was able to locate the missing person in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they're supposed to be trained more.
Drones are already widely used in police operations and their use will become more common and widespread in the future.
This is what I dare to say, says Himberg.
In addition to searching for missing persons, the police can use drones, for example, in accident or crime scene investigation and certain types of intelligence tasks, according to Himberg.
For example, you may have to check out an area a little farther away where there is a potential for violence.
The drone can then be used for reconnaissance.
Karelian rugby is in the first division .
Karelian Rugby celebrated in Kuopio on Saturday after winning the 2nd division.
The Joensuu team was still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second period and defeated the southern guests 26-12.
The championship of the 2nd division also gave Karelian Rugby a historic promotion to the 1st division.
Previously, the club has played in the first division, but at that time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, the SM league and the multi-division 1 division.
The club is going to take the championship, but it means a lot of work for next winter.
We need to expand the roster from under 20 players to 25.
Division 1 also means an increase in the number of matches and longer matchdays, so funding must be matched accordingly.
Eagle's Nest will start the season in Montreal, head coach confirms.
Claude Julien, the head coach of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL), confirmed on the team's Twitter account that Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal drafted superstar prospect Eagle Point, 18, in the first round with the number three pick in the summer draft.
The forward joined Montreal's practice squad in late summer and has put up strong performances in September's training camp games.
In his first training match, he scored a goal.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big steps in his development since arriving at the camp.
The NHL regular season begins next week on the night of Thursday.
Montreal takes on the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What makes a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership in Finland this week.
In an interview with HS, Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of Nokia's Board of Directors, explained his management philosophy in his book The Paranoid Optimist.
He also criticised the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila vehemently denied the allegations, but previous Nokia reports have pointed to the inability of managers to work as a team, fear and silence, which partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The risk-taking and agility of the company in its ascendant phase disappeared.
During the week, Helsinki also hosted the Nordic Business Forum, a major business event which attracted the cream of Finnish business to the exhibition centre.
In addition to the headliner, Barack Obama, 12 stars from the world of business took the stage.
Enough talk about good leadership.
Legendary management guru Gary Hamel once said that a great leader must have the courage to take the company into the future even when things are going well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally attached to past decisions.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a chain known for its organic foods, said that a leader must be able to communicate the company's purpose to the entire workforce.
And that purpose cannot simply be to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote a best-selling book about introverts, told me that studies show that the most successful leaders are humble.
They act calmly, quietly and decisively.
Most of the time, they're introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance, reminded the audience that the qualities of a good leader must match the stage of a company's life cycle.
In the early stages of a company, a leader needs to be able to tell the story on which the company's future rests.
When a company grows to maturity, it needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These lessons were heard by 7 500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum - mainly Finnish managers.
The danger they faced was a flash of information.
It takes a lot to be a good leader.
That's why leadership so often goes wrong, even at the highest levels.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other behind the scenes in a friendly way.
However, it is unlikely that they questioned whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy for an outsider to discern.
Sara Chafak arrived in stunning red carpet attire straight from Los Angeles, where she spends most of her year abroad.
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Miss World final in a stunning black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland dress also had a lacy train.
You know, a little bit of pot jet lag.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me his news.
Chafak says he's going to L.A. for an audition.
He's done commercials, among other things.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to Finland.
However, he says that it is necessary to work harder than ever, since it is always easy to find a replacement for a model.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors is awarded a €30,000 live art prize in Kuopio

Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to her surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments where they have previously been lacking, the jury described the winner.
In addition to Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the prize.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group working in the field of live art.
Danish police find Volvo wanted in major operation: 'We can't say where'
An extensive search by the Danish police has yielded results.
At the start of the operation, traffic was blocked on the Jutland and Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Zealand to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark was closed.
Police are looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
The head of the media centre of the Copenhagen police has been contacted by IS.
We've located the vehicle you were looking for.
We cannot yet say where the car was found, Henrik Storm of the Copenhagen police told Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo police are looking for has no direct connection to the threat.
He says the worst is over.
The Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet reported on Saturday's police press conference.
The head of the investigation, Jørgen Bergen Skov, remained silent about the operation.
He didn't want to say what kind of case they're investigating.
However, Skov said it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people's lives.
The operation is looking for three people.
The police won't say if they've caught them yet.
According to the paper, restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
STT reports that according to the police, however, the general public no longer has cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has been a source of controversy for decades - now the people will vote on the issue in a disputed election
Macedonia, in the Balkans, is currently voting on a proposal to change the country's name.
According to the agreement between the governments of Macedonia and Greece, the country would be renamed the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far used its veto to block Macedonia's bid to join NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The referendum question does not mention the new name, but asks whether the voter supports Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO by accepting the agreement.
Voting began slowly, at least at a school in the center of the capital, Skopje.
A retired nurse, Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
A referendum means change if it opens the door to Europe and NATO.
It is a game changer, especially for young people, he said.
Since its independence in 1991, Macedonia has been officially known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for approval of the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the outcome, there is the excitement of whether turnout will exceed the required 50 percent.
The referendum is non-binding, but a "yes" vote would give a mandate to change the constitution.
A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The agreement also has to be approved by the Greek Parliament.
The polling stations will close at 8 p.m.
What a victory!
Robert Helenius has knocked out Erka Teper .
Late Saturday night, Robert Helenius faced off against Erkan Teper in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn took on his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
The main event of the evening was the IBF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship match.
The winner may be given the opportunity to compete on Saturday in tougher challenges of considerable economic importance.
Helenius decided the fight in the eighth round when he knocked Teper out with a hard left hand.
Teper could no longer get up from the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent in the third round when the German's nose started bleeding.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight back in December of 2015.
That's when Teper claimed an injury and withdrew from the fight.
Afterwards, it turned out that the German had failed two doping tests.
Helenius has a professional record of 28 fights and two losses.
Teper, who entered the match as a clear favorite, has won 19 professional fights in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton with the team order to win - the difference to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One world championship title was once again within reach as Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton won the Russian Grand Prix and extended his lead over Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There's only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who started the race from pole position, finished second.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas, who took the first win of his career, held the lead until halfway through the race, when Mercedes told Bottas to let Hamilton by.
Vettel was third, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari was fourth.
Starting from the back of the grid, Red Bull's Max Verstappen was fifth.
The two assaulted a Jewish man in Joensuu . They were caught a block away .
Two men beat and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensuu at Siltkatu 12 on Saturday after 6 pm.
Police say the men also seized the victim's cell phone, among other items.
Police caught up with the suspects, a 35-year-old man from Hays and a 39-year-old man from Pleasant, a block away shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police said.
The victim sustained contusions that didn't require medical attention.
Elon Musk, CEO of electric car company Tesla, is stepping down as chairman of the company's board.
Musk has reached an agreement with the US authorities.
Meanwhile, Musk has been fined $20 million for tweets claiming he secured funding to take Tesla private.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Musk with securities fraud.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of 20 million euros if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is upheld in court.
Canada is in a race against time to reach a NAFTA agreement with the United States.
Time is running out in the midst of negotiations between the United States and Canada on the NAFTA free trade agreement.
The United States has set a Sunday deadline, and negotiators from both countries have been in intense discussions all weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech to the UN General Assembly to focus on the trade negotiations.
About a year ago, at the urging of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada, and Mexico began negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, an agreement was reached between Mexico and the United States, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want the agreement to enter into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the winner of the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's participation in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that he plans to sign the treaty by the end of November, with or without Canada.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready by Sunday to allow sufficient time for the US Congress to assess it.
A neighbour mistook a candle for a fire in Kaakkur - the fire brigade was called .
Burning candles in an apartment building in Kaakkur, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night before Sunday.
Dozens of emergency services units were called to the scene due to a possible fire in an apartment building.
It was discovered that candles burning in the sauna of an apartment building looked like a fire in the house across the street, and the fire department was notified.
There was no fire in the target.
Police arrested 11 people after the Honka-HJK match - rioting at the stadium and subway station
Police arrested eleven people on Saturday after the Honka-HJK match of the men's football league in Espoo, Teemu Värtinen of the Western Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to STT.
The reason for the arrest was protection from crime and disturbance.
MEPs in the committee are calling on the Commission and the Member States to take the necessary steps to ensure that the directive is implemented as soon as possible.
Earlier, Ilta-Sanomat reported about the captives.
The game ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large crowd of spectators rushed onto the field from the stands reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushing and fistfights between supporters of the teams.
Among other things, mounted police were needed to quell the situation.
In addition to the airport, rioting occurred in the area of a nearby subway station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I wasn't there, but from what I saw of the pictures, the situation was unpleasant.
According to Värtinen, no criminal charges have been filed as a result of the events.
Pöytäkivi shocked the butterfly whistle during his SE World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi have advanced to the finals on the final day of the 3/7 swimming World Cup in the Netherlands.
The competition will be held in Eindhoven on a short course.
HSS's Pöytäkivi broke the Finnish record in the 50-meter butterfly, where he was second in the preliminaries with a time of 22.82.
Earlier in September, Pöytäkivi swam a distance of SE time of 22.77 in Helsinki.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen of Cetus, Espoo, finished 24th in the butterfly with a time of 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen was sixth in the preliminary rounds of the 50 meter breaststroke with a time of 30.48 and advanced to the final.
In the preliminary rounds of the 200-meter individual medley, Laukkanen was 15th with a time of 2:14.25.
Students act out a rare delicacy , a stripped-down version of the ancient tragedy , the Oresteia .
Ancient tragedies are a rare delicacy on Finnish stages.
For example, the National Theater last staged an ancient tragedy, Sophocles' Philoctetes, in 1988.
Now the Academy of Performing Arts has brought the only complete trilogy of plays from antiquity, Aeschylus' Oresteia, on a tour starting from the National Theatre.
In the Lavat auki! projects, which started in 2015, the acting students of the Theatre Academy work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The Oresteia had its international premiere in Berlin in April.
Roiha's adaptation of the Oresteia eagerly condenses the story of the end of the blood feud of the doomed House of Atreus and the birth of the rule of law into one hour and twenty minutes, especially by condensing the choral parts.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuuri's fine Finnish translation (2003).
Dramatic lighting and a revealing display on the sides of the theater space emphasize the simplicity and clarity of theatrical thinking.
At its heart is the dynamic between the performers, who take turns breaking away from the chorus, playing the titular roles, and the chorus.
The performance uses both double and triple interpretations of the title roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so the murders of Agamemnon, returning from the Trojan War, and his spoils of war, Cassandra, for example, are also shown on the stage, contrary to the ancient tradition of performance.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize its faithfulness to ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created before the eyes of the viewer, constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out a rhythmic group of master's degree acting students acting as a close-knit group, almost as one organism.
Especially in the choral parts, the actors, who are very expressive and flexible in sculptural group formations, are allowed to perform naked on the stage, only decorated with a white curtain.
That's very impressive.
The tour of the Oresteia continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer builds its first hydrogen truck
This innovation is beginning to take shape in Europe, thanks in particular to a cooperation agreement with Hyundai and the Swiss company H2 Energy.
Under the terms of the cooperation agreement announced at the IAA in Hanover, Hyundai will supply a batch of 1 000 new models to the Swiss company and its partners.
With the launch of the fuel cell truck, Hyundai is continuing to build on the success of the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a hydrogen car manufacturer.
With this project, the first of its kind in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by following the development of the refuelling network", said In Cheol Lee, Vice President of Hyundai Motor at the announcement of the agreement.
The fists were waved several times in Kajaani.
A man in his early 30's assaulted three men in and around a restaurant in the center of Kajaani on Saturday morning.
The man first struck a man inside the restaurant and was removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the attacker hit him as well.
The police caught the assailant.
At the police station, the man continued his aggressive behavior and kicked another officer in the leg.
He also threatened to assault and kill a police officer.
They took him to jail to calm him down.
We're investigating three counts of assault and one count of resisting arrest.
In the centre of Kajaani, on Välikatu, another assault took place on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, the victim was struck by a Cajan man in his 20s.
A short time later, he was knocked to the ground by another man and kicked by the same man.
Outsiders pulled the assailants away from the victim, and police were called.
However, the perpetrators had already left before the police arrived.
Witnesses are asked to contact the Kajaani police on 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at tutkinta.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long-distance radio host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, known as a long-time journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of terminal liver cancer, which he announced on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Oh, this is happening.
Even the doctor has said it, I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
We need to ensure the safety of the store's aunts and uncles.
The first time I got paid for a story was in 1984.
In this day and age, when a story makes you wonder, it's usually a big story.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärää, a working environment expert from the Professional Association of Service Industries (PAM).
He says the crime statistics don't reflect reality.
It's a growing problem, despite what the employers say.
Only cases that are clearly considered serious are reported to the police, and many actual acts of violence go unreported.
"Companies are, of course, obliged to compile statistics on their near-miss situations under the Occupational Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data are not collected anywhere", he said.
Emotional injuries don't end up in the statistics.
The problem with violent situations has always been that they do not always result in physical injury.
Nevertheless, the emotional scars can be far more serious than bruises and wounds.
The distinction between a situation of violence and a situation of threatened violence is difficult to draw, since even a certain level of aggressive threat must count as violence - even if there is no physical assault.
Too many people are afraid at work, even when there's no actual action.
There's a lot of unrest in some neighborhoods.
The store has hired security.
When the opening hours of shops were liberalised, there was considerable publicity in the media about the effects on the safety of shopkeepers.
"Back then, many employers arranged for security services at least during the night hours and to prevent people from working alone", Kähärä comments.
When nothing happens, you jump to the wrong conclusion.
This would now appear to have had an efficient effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
When security kept disturbances well under control, the impression arose that guarding would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, efforts are being made to eliminate costly security services.
A minor assault is a civil offense, and it is understandable that an assaulted clerk would not want to file a police report against a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But a subsection of the same law, enacted in 2011, makes minor assaults prosecutable if they occur in the workplace.
I think what we need now are precedents.
The next time an aunt or an uncle is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should prosecute.
If the courts would put a few abusers in jail and sentence them to the harsh end of the punishment scale, manners would improve.
In a society where even small shops have to be open 24 hours a day, the safety of their employees must be guaranteed.
Heidi Sohlberg signed off for Miss before the live broadcast, "Sara, Iiro is married".
This year's Miss Universe pageant will not be televised as usual, but will be broadcast live on the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL studio host Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and red carpet will be hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the three presenters briefed the guests and members of the media who had arrived on the scene.
First, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a big round of applause.
Now all the women scream!
Now look at our male host, Sohlberg cheering his colleague as the audience cheered.
Many Miss Finland from previous years will be watching from the front row.
Among others, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi were sitting next to each other and Sohlberg even made a little joke at one of them.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg swung and looked at Saroi.
Most likely, Sohlberg was referring to the recently divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, although he seemed confused at first.
Sieppi spoke about his divorce for the first time in the weekend edition of Ilta-Sanomat.
Miss Beauty said that she does not want to reveal the reasons for the divorce in public, because it is a matter between her and Roope Salminen.
He said he wasn't in a hurry to start a new relationship, that he was going to focus on himself.
I am concentrating on my own things and, above all, I am starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marital status came to light even later, when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The trio of hosts laughed at the screwup.
Iiro was married, wasn't he?
Janni Hussi signed off on the screwup.
A Scandinavian man tortured his unbound wife by cutting, burning, and feeding her hot sauce.
The Ostrobothnia District Court has sentenced a 34-year-old man from Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous crimes against his common-law wife.
The murder weapon included a belt, a cable, and a pair of handcuffs.
The court ruled that the items in question were forfeited to the State.
Rank's charge was aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the district court.
Kokkolainen was charged with four counts of assault, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two counts of damage.
The crimes took place between March 26th and May 24th of last year.
As a result of the last actions, the man was caught and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday last week, the Ostrobothnia District Court handed down its verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in prison in Vaasa.
There's no evidence of rape.
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated deprivation of liberty and one count of aggravated rape on May 22.
However, these charges were dismissed by the court as unsubstantiated.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge made a public announcement of the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had subjected his spouse to violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been tied up.
The accused slashed his victim with a knife, burned him with a cigarette, fed him a strong sauce, and poured water and coffee over him.
In its verdict, the court ordered the State to confiscate the instruments of crime: the belt and cable, the handcuffs, the bathrobe belt, the knife and the crowbar.
The Four Witnesses
According to the district court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
According to the verdict, many of the most egregious acts occurred at the end of the crime period.
The court heard four witnesses, two women and two men.
The 34-year-old must pay his victim compensation for pain, suffering and temporary damage totalling €5,800.
I don't think he has that kind of money. He's a convicted felon with a long history of collecting debts.
It's not the first time he's been in jail.
The name of the convict is being withheld to protect the victim's privacy.
At the time of writing, the recent court ruling is not legally binding.
Europe has a four-point lead in the Ryder Cup.
On Saturday, European golf professionals held on to their lead in the traditional hole-in-one against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup on the outskirts of Paris 10-6 with 12 singles matches still to play on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four-ball matches that began on Saturday, and the afternoon four-ball match was tied 2-2.
Europe's leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played as a pair during Friday and Saturday.
No European couple had ever achieved this before.
On Sunday, the duo will aim for more history.
No European player has ever won five points in a single Ryder Cup, and only three Americans have done so: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters at the Honka match: "Violence has no place in football"
Football betting league team HJK released a statement on Sunday condemning the disruptive behavior of its supporters at Saturday's FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"On behalf of our fans, we regret the events following the Honka-HJK match", the statement said.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed onto the field, some seemingly trying to pick a fight with Honga supporters.
There was also a brawl between supporters.
The riot police were unable to calm the situation, and police and mounted police were called in.
HJK said in a statement that the players and staff were shocked by the incident.
What happened after the game is not in keeping with the values of our 111-year-old club.
"We firmly dissociate ourselves from any action that jeopardizes the security of the matches", the statement said.
The HJK promises to assist the authorities and the event organisers in identifying threats to safety and in eliminating minor incidents.
Fan culture is part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We will do our utmost to support positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football stadiums.
"Violence has no place in it", says the press release.
A Filipino inventor is flying a drone car to avoid traffic jams.
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and something called Pelle Peloton.
He's now one of a growing number of people around the world who swear they've invented a flying car, or at least their own version of one.
Its competitors include Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of his device.
According to reports from around the world, the man has used much of his fortune to build his dream.
He started working on his flying car six years ago.
Now he's calling the development a drone car.
Recently, he claims to have made the first successful test flight, flying his device at an altitude of over seven meters.
In fact, one of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I'm hoping the machine will generate a positive response.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to Britain's Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Tomorrow's industrial action will be reflected in childcare and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors, the ban on overtime and shift changes, which will come into force tomorrow, will be particularly visible in social and health services and child day care, according to JHL chairman Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be widespread and will certainly be reflected in a shortage of staff.
Everyone has to figure out how to pick up their kids.
It is now the employer's job to ensure that services are functioning and that no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine tells STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of staff was also apparent at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from working overtime and changing shifts due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibilities, for staff not to be hired, but for workers to stay on overtime or change shifts.
This isn't a strike yet.
It is perfectly normal from an occupational safety point of view that regular working hours are maintained for each employee and that only these are worked.
JHL is taking action to oppose the government's plans to weaken protection against dismissal for small firms.
Municipal Employers' Labour Market Director Markku Jalonen will not pre-assess the effects of bans on overtime and shift changes.
However, he does not believe they will be very disruptive, although services may be weakened.
Employers throughout Finland are aware of this and have made the necessary preparations.
The area is so incredibly wide, the social and health action and the technical sector, that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary greatly between sectors, regions and employers, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week they already gained experience from similar three-day activities organised by Superi, a nursing association, and Tehy, a social and healthcare organisation.
The effects were fairly minor.
JHL's ban on overtime and shift changes applies to employees in the municipal, church, state and private social and health sectors, among others.
For example, family day carers are excluded.
At this stage, the strike affects almost 100 000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the law on dismissals continues.
It's time for the government to admit they're running up against a brick wall and they're running hard.
Jalosen believes that both the trade union movement and the government must meet.
The Commission's proposals are based on the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
The Great Barrier Reef is being created by the combined efforts of children and adults .
The Great Coral Reef by the collective Toisissa tiloissa had its premiere last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, The Great Barrier Reef is a work that is built from start to finish together with the audience.
This time, however, a clearer presentation will be constructed, which will refresh and crystallise the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is plenty of fairy-tale magic in the theatre play, even for the child participants.
The child's point of view has already been taken into account in the preparation of the work.
But the Great Barrier Reef is not a children's show. It is a cooperative effort between adults and children.
It provides adults with information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
Children's ability to engage in exercises and play together also bridges the gap between adults and children.
So the Great Barrier Reef is somewhat like a fairy tale ballet, a fitness club and a nature awareness campaign, but ultimately it's set in a different, non-human environment around the visitors.
The Great Barrier Reef begins with an exploration of the coral and fish life cycles.
Six different gymnastic circles teach, among other things, the gestures of a ray and a sea horse.
Finally, a spectacle lasting just under an hour features music, lights, glittering paint, and costumes to help you learn about life on the reef.
In the Great Barrier Reef, there are both people diving to observe coral life and corals being observed.
We're also coral-viewing creatures.
The gazes and observations in many directions make the show dense and full of life.
Let there be a landscape of some organism, an organism looking at the landscape, and another organism or landscape looking at the organism, and all this at the same time.
It doesn't seem that hard to a kid.
The 'Other spaces' group is trying to push the boundaries of thought and action, which is a challenge when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the presence of children makes it more meaningful.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration for endangered corals will be held at Sitrator.
Disasters beyond human comprehension should not be allowed to harden us, even though it may be difficult to grasp the significance of exercising our own compassion in the face of such disasters.
In other spaces, he has built his work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species and their future generations for whom it makes room for wonder and play.
Kids grow up too fast - I'm glad I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid
Today's children and teenagers are more irresponsible than ever.
Young people start smoking and drinking at younger and younger ages.
I think kids should be kids their whole childhood and not mess up their lives with drugs and sex because everyone else says they will.
I was stunned when my friend told me that she had to pick up her fifth-grade sister from her "boyfriend's" house for the weekend.
When he came to pick up his drunk sister, she told him about her sexual experiences that night.
There's no way I could imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned our entire childhoods that drugs are off limits and sex is for adults.
I hope that today's children will be able to have a decent childhood and not have to grow up prematurely because of peer pressure.
I'm constantly seeing pictures on Instagram of younger and younger girls wearing makeup and revealing clothes.
Snapchat is used to take and send revealing photos at night.
With girls, it's getting harder to tell how old they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily pass for 18-year-olds and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't grow up with smartphones.
I got to be a kid for many, many years and not have to worry about what other people think of me.
The authorities have told the head of state that the case of Airiston Helmi is not related to national security.
Parliament adopted a non-binding resolution approving the Commission's proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies.
The Finnish government has been told that the investigation into Airiston Helme is not currently related to national security but to organized crime, reports Yle.
The information from anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by Ilkka Kanerva, chairman of the defence committee.
MEPs in the committee are calling on the Commission and the Member States to take the necessary steps to ensure that the new directive is implemented as soon as possible.
This is seen primarily as a financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else, Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to information from the Supreme Court, so far no evidence has been found that the seized material is related to national security, but the investigation is still in its early stages.
We have no way of knowing yet what may be revealed there, says one of those interviewed by Yle.
The extensive house searches that began a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is only about economic crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, Iltalehti compiled an article reviewing the arguments for and against.
Video: The dream goal that saved Liverpool's unbeaten run
Liverpool's 100 per cent start to the Premier League season came to an end, but they were still the more content team with a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away with a 1-0 away win.
And that's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal throughout the Premier League that City were now serious.
Everybody remembers how last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp had the same idea when he arrived in west London.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to be in sole control of his own end of the pitch.
Chelsea, meanwhile, had a fine away win in the League Cup at Anfield Road on Wednesday.
And that's when Eden Hazard came off the bench to win the match with a brilliant individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was there from the opening minutes.
In the 25th minute, he first fought the ball in a small space in a three-way with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croat sees Hazard charging forward and delivers a perfectly weighted cross.
Hazard drives a little bit to the edge of the penalty area, but he bombards from there with a perfect left-footed shot into the back of the bottom corner.
Poole's goalkeeper, Alisson, was a little slow in defence and could only get his fingertip on the ball.
Klopp must have felt the defeat slightly unfair, because almost immediately afterwards, Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah's drive from the goal line.
In the second episode, Chelsea's Kepa also got into action.
The goalkeeper reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's move and pushed the ball from the post for a corner kick.
At the other end of the pitch, Alisson scored a free-kick to put Hazard through.
The best moment for the visitors came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his cross.
However, the brass star's punch was directed at teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' lead.
And even that came to an end in the 89th minute when substitute Daniel Sturridge was given a free kick from 25 yards.
Sturridge was playing in his old home stadium, and the striker bombed it in honour of an irresistible bet on the top corner.
Liverpool's 100 per cent start to the season has ended in a 1-1 draw, but they remain top of the league alongside Manchester City.
Chelsea are also closely involved in the championship fight two points behind the leaders.
The clock-shift debate is in full swing.
I remember that a few decades ago a magazine asked various influential people in Finland what divides the Finnish people.
And Juice Widow's response was the only thing that stuck in my mind, the tip of her nose.
Some people have a last name that ends in "n", and some people don't.
Dividing lines can be drawn anywhere, and this was one of them.
Finland has succeeded in getting the EU to abandon the annual clock change.
There is widespread agreement that moving the clocks twice a year has been foolish and has caused all sorts of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest part of the solution, at least in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The main difficulty now is deciding which clock to use - the current daylight saving time, daylight saving time, or some other time zone.
The public can also express their views on the otakantaa.fi website.
The questionnaire has been launched by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will remain open until Friday 12 October.
Coffee tables and social media are buzzing with discussion, and everyone has something to say.
Advocates of wintertime argue that morning light affects people's well-being, while supporters of summertime argue that evening light affects people's desire to be outdoors and thus their well-being.
Both positions have strong supporters and good reasons.
Studies also show that morning light gives a person a rhythm to his day and refreshes him.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, light increases people's movement outdoors and gives better opportunities for, for example, autumn yard work.
The amount of extra light after a normal working day has already been calculated per hour.
I'd prefer to take both, but unfortunately, with our position in the northern hemisphere, there's nothing we can do.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
Typical of a debate on a subject is that one side is pushing and the other side is pushing back very strongly.
You don't really listen to the other person's arguments, because what's important is how you feel about it.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat futile to try to change someone's mind.
That's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is terribly easy to debate, because it does not require a great deal of effort and the arguments are sufficient.
This type of issue is usually the subject of the fiercest and most fruitless debate.
I mean, sure, it sucks when the wrong person gets elected, but I guess we'll just have to live with it.
And it always provides a convenient scapegoat if life seems bleak.
Josba fought to a narrow away victory.
Josba's first away game at Divar produced a full three series points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Wall River with a jubilant 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) win.
Nurmo was still leading by a goal early in the third period, but Josba was picking up lines and recycling men in chains.
In a time of 50.47, the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi scored the winning goal, 6-5.
On the ice for both teams, the decisive minutes were played to a draw.
The most efficient Josba was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second set was also very powerful, as Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also scored.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also scored his goal in the second half.
Josba has six points after three rounds of the series.
The next match is against O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks.
Sunday at my uncle's church for the bicentennial.
Tomorrow, Sunday, the 200th anniversary of the founding of the church will be celebrated in a somber atmosphere.
Last week's arson at the Church of the Ascension was a shock.
My uncle's church was guarded for two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, tonight is still a time for celebration.
Although no one would like it, Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Congregation.
The church on the hill in the center of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipal and other alliances in the world.
Family Mass begins today at 10:00 a.m. at Eno Church.
Then we move on to the parish hall for a Karelian banquet.
There's a full day of indoor and outdoor activities.
The church building, for example, can be explored under the guidance of Ari Räsäsen, a retired parish priest who served for 37 years.
The celebration of the birth of the Church also marks the end of an era.
The now decommissioned Kingdom Hall, built in 1982, will open its doors today for the last time.
Now we are in temporary premises in the former town hall, says pastor Markku Koistinen.
The parish hall was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has stood strong for 200 years.
Elon Musk steps down as chairman of Tesla after $40 million settlement
Electric car maker Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have settled their lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC suspected Musk of committing securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined from the company he founded.
However, Musk will remain CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will have to step down as Tesla's chairman of the board for three years.
The company will have to hire an outside chairman of the board.
Musk will also face increased scrutiny.
The agreement requires Tesla to hire two independent directors and to monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will each pay USD 20 million (approximately EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruption and harm to Tesla shareholders", said Steven Peikin, chairman of the SEC.
The story began in August, when Musk tweeted that he might pull the company from the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secure.
That tweet sent Tesla's stock soaring for a while.
The SEC suspected Musk of committing securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not discussed the arrangement with other executives or potential investors.
In effect, the agency was accusing Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that it was suing the company and Musk.
The SEC said it would demand that Musk be fined and banned from ever serving as a director of a public company again.
The SEC's challenge spooked investors and sent Tesla's stock plummeting.
More than 800 killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami
The death toll from the earthquake and resulting tsunami in Indonesia has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency, reports AFP.
The death toll is expected to rise as the damage is still being assessed.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure could be in the thousands.
Friday's earthquake triggered a tsunami that hit the town of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
A tsunami warning was issued immediately after the quake, but it was quickly canceled.
Officials say almost all the known deaths so far are from Palu.
Rescue authorities are concerned about the situation in Donggala, near the epicentre, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already, many people are known to have died.
Cries for Help From the Ruins
The Indonesian army has been called in to help rescue workers search for victims.
President Joko Widodo, who arrived in the disaster area today, urged the military to continue the rescue effort day and night.
One of the focal points of rescue efforts is a hotel in Palu, where 50 to 60 people are still believed to be trapped.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the agency in charge of rescue efforts, said that one person was pulled alive from the rubble of the Roa-Roa Hotel, a popular destination for business travelers, during the night.
We also heard people crying for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy-duty clearing equipment would be urgently needed in the quake and tsunami zone.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find missing loved ones.
Those of you on the Palus and in the vicinity, help.
My friend's family members are still missing, one writer appealed in a Facebook group.
Telephone numbers of politicians leaked to mobsters in Britain
Many British politicians were subjected to harassment when their contact information was leaked due to flaws in the app's encryption.
Among other things, the intruders accessed the phone numbers of government ministers.
It was an app used at the Conservative Party conference in Britain.
For example, Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who campaigned for Brexit, were subjected to harassment.
Several congressmen received harassing phone calls.
Due to the app's lack of encryption, the public was able to access politicians' profiles on the Conservative Party's annual conference mobile app.
The public accessed the profiles using the politician's e-mail address, which was readily available online.
Anyone who logged on to the profile could view and edit the material stored on the profile.
Someone managed to temporarily replace Boris Johnson's profile picture with a pornographic image and an insulting headline.
Michael Goven's profile picture was replaced with that of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that a conferencing app allows you to log into other people's profiles with their email addresses.
The logged-in user can then view the contact information of the profile person and, for example, send messages on their behalf.
Parliament adopted a nonbinding resolution approving the Commission's proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.
A Conservative Party spokesman apologised for the leak.
He said the technical problems have been resolved and the app is now working safely.
The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has supported the leak.
The app was developed by Crown Comms, an Australian company.
The opposition Labour Party criticises the Conservative Party for not being reliable in matters of security.
Every week the audience of The Wall Finland is a large crowd of applauding Poles
Attentive viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience of the quiz show The Wall Finland.
The Wall, an American format that has spread rapidly around the world, landed on the Finnish version of Channel 4 last Saturday.
Hosted by Heikki Paasonen, the game show is filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the filming possibilities were exceptional, since the format's large 40-foot-high [12 m] game wall required space.
During the inaugural season, social media featured the show's studio audience, which was speculated to be Polish.
On Twitter, there was a discussion about whether the Poles sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, head of domestic programming at Channel 4, explains the matter to Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience includes people close to the players, other Finns, expatriate Finns living in Poland and just Polish viewers.
In the Finnish production, the audience consists of international applauders, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who attend the filming of different programmes, Sormunen explains.
He points out that it is not so difficult to follow the game itself, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
The red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish.
For foreign-language audiences, however, interpreters are on hand to provide translation services.
There are two interpreters who are interpreting simultaneously for the studio director at all times.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of flap is being thrown and what situation is going on, says Sormunen.
He compares the situation to the recent treatment of David Hasselhoff in a domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was on the set of Talent Finland here in Finland.
He heard simultaneous interpretation all the time and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish during the filming of The Fellowship of the Ring.
As the typhoon that devastated parts of southern Japan moves toward the main islands, authorities warn of landslides and flooding.
Authorities also warn of possible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people on the Typhoon Tram were injured, but officials said there were no major injuries and no fatalities so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, winds have been so strong that they have turned cars upside down.
According to public broadcaster NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters and power has been cut to over 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been canceled, and bullet trains are at a standstill because of the storm.
The storm is expected to make landfall near Osaka around noon today.
Although the capital, Tokyo, is not directly in the storm's path, strong winds and heavy rains are expected there too.
All trains have been canceled in Tokyo today.
Meteorologists say Trami will plague Japan until Monday.
The skies of the aces grew darker and darker
It's been a bad start to the season for the Aces.
The sky was already almost pitch black when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) to Vaasa Sport at home on Saturday.
The Porians have now lost five games in a row and have two points from six rounds.
No Ace defenseman or player in the bottom two has scored yet.
And the pressures are mounting all the time.
With nearly half the game left, the stadium was filled to capacity.
We're only six games in, and there's obviously no reason to give up.
Well, you have to worry, because that's how badly we played.
Especially the performance of the second round was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki told.
The sport, of course, had a taste for victory.
The team was down a game on Friday, so you'd think it would show.
Maybe it showed, but the Aces didn't know how to capitalize on it.
Bread Day continued to grow in attendance
Pirkko Hyvärinen, the Mother of Bread Day, looks around the large hall and is amazed at the number of people attending the event.
Somehow it was thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Hyvärinen reflects in the morning.
In autumn 2017, at the same time as Bread Day, the Traktorikynnö SM competitions were held, so perhaps it would be expected that the number of spectators could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, the opposite happened; the corridors were blocked well before ten o'clock, the vendors said that the products were finished, the news porridge was sold more than before, almost 500 servings, and Hyvärinen heard that the number of cars had also increased.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
The five-hour morning and afternoon sessions were especially well suited for families with children, and this must have attracted a record attendance.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach further afield.
Also, sellers flock to Liper from a larger area each year.
This year nearly a hundred exhibitors, craftsmen, bakers, and vendors had come to the bakery.
Bread Day's mother PIrkko Hyvärinen was admiring the crowd from the hall.
The Day of Unleavened Bread began with a blessing on the harvest.
In the children's category, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
The children's bread-baking contest received 11 different shapes of bread.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, the winner of the rye bread competition, spent the day in the pie shop.
Seven of the most beautiful lights in the world .
Bring the space to life, set the right mood for the decor, and read a book without straining your eyes.
Good lighting is worth the investment.
We've rounded up three good reasons to invest in lighting.
Tarja Jokiniemi, head of sales and marketing at Innolux, gave some tips.
Do your eyes a favor.
The importance of enlightenment increases with advancing age.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many experience as they age, as their eyesight deteriorates and glare affects more and more people.
As we get older, our need for light also increases.
A 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a 20-year-old.
So, for health reasons alone, it is worth investing in the healing effects and properties of light.
A good lamp gives enough light but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi suggests.
Create Beauty Around You
A beautiful interior can only be enhanced with the right lighting solutions.
I'm a modern interior decorator. I have a choice.
A popular style is the japandi, a combination of Scandinavian and Japanese gestures.
On the other hand, modern and playful retro styles inspired by the '70's, with bright colors, various shades of metal, or ice cream colors, are also booming.
Authenticity, like everything else in a home, has its appeal.
Materials now include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather, and bamboo.
Let your personality shine through
On the other hand, people are investing more in their homes than ever before, and decorating has become a way of expressing themselves.
Instead of mass-produced, they want customized, bold lighting for their home, with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products with a known origin and designer.
So let's be very design conscious, says Jokiniemi.
It is not necessary to have the latest fashionable lamp in the home, but a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain timeless, ornate, and elegant classics endure year after year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian striker after three games
Koo Koo and forward Brendan O'Donnell have parted ways.
The Canadian striker played a total of three League matches in the orange shirt without power points, KooKoo says in a press release.
O'Donnell joined KooKoo in August on a one-year contract, which included a trial period until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old forward played for Kunlund Red Star in the KHL and KRS Heilongjiang in the VHL.
There's no word yet on O'Donnell's new company.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - goods go out into the world in recycling bins, plastic changed to paper
The games specialist Pelimies now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the customers of the brick-and-mortar store are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from online stores are packaged, for example, in packaging from importers.
All the packages that come to us are recycled.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in a usable condition, says Ville Puurula of Oulu Pelimiehen.
The company mainly uses newspapers and similar recycled materials as upholstery material.
Bubble wrap shall be avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we intend to use recycled material in our envelopes too.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
Recycling is not, according to Puurula, an extra hassle.
It's not a big deal to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings, for example by recycling cardboard packaging.
Recycling is a natural fit for the activities of Gamemaster since, in addition to new products, the store's core product range includes used games and equipment.
For every fashion-conscious shopper, the same shirt works for every outfit.
You know, the classics work from one season to the next as much as they do in a costume.
Their versatility provides the basis for a good wardrobe, since quality classics make it easy to assemble a variety of outfits at low cost.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are quality sweaters.
This category also includes black polo shirts.
A black knitted polo collar made of natural material cannot be a faulty purchase.
The garment can be paired with slacks, a skirt, or even jeans, creating a subdued yet flamboyant look.
The polonaise suits both the youthful modern dresser and the classically sophisticated stylist.
That's how you build a style.
Autumn's trendiest collection is made up of golden brown corduroy trousers with wide sleeves, a black polo knit and grey ankle boots.
The classic halter top, together with the other classics, the blue-green plaid skirt and the burgundy loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated ensemble.
Add an edge to a black halter top by combining it with casual trendy garments: a denim skirt, high boots, and thick stockings.
Young and classy!
Russian intelligence has a long history of sabotage.
There is no reason to believe that the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation (SVR) or the Military Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation (GRU) have abandoned this policy.
During the Soviet era, so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaya grupa: sabotage and intelligence group.
KGB agents in the West prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, according to Vasili Mitrokhin (1922-2004), a KGB archivist who defected to the West.
His data was published in books by Christopher Andrew in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries, and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB supplied the DRG with uniforms and equipment for the Bundeswehr, railways, game wardens and road workers for covert operations.
The aim of the forces is to 'protect the people of the Donetsk People's Republic and territorial integrity of Ukraine.'
During the Cold War, agents hid supply packages containing mines, explosives, detonators, and communications equipment in the field for sabotage teams.
As recently as 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland with a booby-trap that exploded when authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
Last night, police arrested four drunk drivers in the county.
Police arrested four drunk drivers in different parts of North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahti had a blood alcohol level of 1.57.
He was driving at half past three in the morning at the beginning of the Kajaani road with two passengers.
At four o'clock in the morning, a car plunged into a ditch on the shore of Kölvijärvi, and a 19-year-old local man who was alone in the car inhaled 1.54 per thousand, according to the police.
He wasn't seriously injured in the driveway.
A 20-year-old out-of-towner driving a car in downtown Outokumpu blew a .33 on the breathalyzer.
Police suspect the male drivers of aggravated drunk driving and the driver of Polvijärvi of endangering traffic safety.
Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, at the intersection of Öllönäntie and Hoikantie, a 36-year-old man who was driving a local van had a blood alcohol level of 0.52 per thousand.
He's a suspect in a DUI.
Police are asking for information about a stabbing at Turku train station after midnight.
Police say the man was assaulted in a parking lot in front of the station with life-threatening consequences.
It was caught on a security camera.

HPK will keep Riska for the rest of the season. Lehtinen's probation is over.
Hämeenlinna's HPK sports director Mika Toivola says that Filip Riska (centre) has been important for the team in the early stages, in the underdog game and in the defensive role of the fourth field.
Filip Riska, who played on trial at the beginning of autumn, will continue in Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to her convinced the management.
Filip's been a big part of our offense in the early part of the game, in the power play, and in the defensive end of the floor.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to keep such an experienced player, HPK's sports director Mika Toivola commented in a club press release.
According to Toivola, Riska's value increases when he plays in the playoffs of the Hockey League.
A centre forward from Pietarsaari, Riska has previously played league hockey for JYP, Lukko and Sport.
Winger Oskari Lehtinen, on the other hand, was left without a contract after the trial period.
The real story on TV tonight, a climber was left for dead twice.
Eighteen years ago, an American, Beck Weathers, wrote a book.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on the man's own experiences.
Tonight's movie is based on them.
Everest will now premiere on Finnish television.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm caught climbers by surprise on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur's 2015 directorial tells the story of a struggle for survival that has been dealt with harshly.
Movies have been made about tragedy, documentaries have been made about tragedy before.
We're going to be reviewing real events in this case as well.
Twenty-two years ago, the world's highest mountain claimed the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders, Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who was Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life may have been saved by eye surgery before he left for Nepal.
As a result of this and the pressure of the air, he lost his eyesight, and the summit had to be abandoned.
Rob Hall moved on and never came back.
But Weathers' life-and-death struggle was just beginning.
When the storm came up, he got lost and couldn't find his way back to camp.
When search parties arrived, they found the man in such bad shape that they did not think he would survive.
Weathers was left for dead.
Miraculously, though, he was able to get back on his feet and find the others.
With Weathers frozen solid, it was thought he was still dying, and once again he was left to his own devices.
It's clear that, contrary to all expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
Eventually, even his fellow climbers became convinced of his potential, so much so that he was given help.
In the movie, Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other cast members include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today is the 200th anniversary of the Eno church.
The 200th anniversary of Eno's church has been celebrated today on Church Hill.
The church was dedicated on October 4, 1818, and in honor of the anniversary, a feast for the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The celebration began at 10 a.m. with a family mass on the church hill in Eno, followed by a Karelian banquet at the Eno parish house.
The church was full.
A total of 517 attended the Family Mass.
Enos' vicar, Armi Rautavuori, was happy that so many people had come to church.
It is a great joy for a long time to come and gives strength for work, says Rautavuori (pictured).
Many have been touched by the fire at the Church of the Epiphany, and it was not overlooked at the 200th anniversary celebration of the Eno congregation.
Eno's church is now the oldest of Joensuu's Evangelical Lutheran congregations after the Kiihtelysvaara church was destroyed in a fire.
The wooden church was completed in 1770.
In the danger zone, a morning service was held to observe silence and remember the church destroyed by the fire.
Photos and video: Medikaani flashed its power in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm swept into Greece from the southwest on Saturday.
A Mediterranean hurricane has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Images from the region show widespread flooding across Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Chiato, in the province of Corinthia, instead of a street due to flooding.
Another video shows a car being carried away by floodwaters.
In the southern Peloponnese, strong winds caused heavy seas.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens is instructing people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The U.S. Embassy urges you to follow all weather forecasts and instructions from local authorities.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings heavy rains and even the threat of flooding.
According to CNN, a study published in 2011 found that globally, the monk seal appears only once or twice a year, typically around September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm that is now blowing left behind floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey northward toward Europe.
Concerns in Greece have also been raised about refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to adequate shelter.
The storm will also hit areas around Athens that were devastated by wildfires this summer.
Greece was also ravaged by the plague of locusts last November.
We shouldn't go to sea now, flights are still on schedule - Thousands of Finns are on holiday on the Greek islands threatened by an autumn storm
Excursions to the sea are canceled, and even when walking, care should be exercised so that branches or other debris do not get caught in the storm.
This is the kind of advice the guides have given to more than 3 500 Finnish holidaymakers in Greece on a weekend with Sun Holidays.
Instructions will be needed as the even more fearsome storm Zorbas is forecast to batter the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, wind gusts near the island of Crete can reach up to 150 feet [45 m] per second.
Adding to the misery are heavy rains.
All passengers travelling from Finland to Greece via Aurinkomatkat and Tui, who have provided their telephone numbers, have been warned of the strong winds by text message.
There's still sun and warmth in the air
According to Inka Ikonen, communications specialist for Sun Travel, by early Saturday evening the resorts will have avoided the worst.
For example, flights have been landing and taking off on a normal schedule.
Of course, we'll be monitoring the situation around the clock.
Safety first.
Antonia Schroderus, the EU's media representative, says their flights have also been running on time.
We're in constant contact with our personnel on the ground.
At least Crete was still quiet, he told me early Saturday night.
The most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, currently have a total of just over 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers spend their holidays in smaller resorts.
For example, the worst of the storm is expected to hit the island of Kos on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, the sun was shining brightly on Rhodes on Saturday afternoon, and the temperature soared to about 80 degrees Fahrenheit [27°C], reports Ikonen.
Zorba has been projected to be Turkey's next problem, albeit slightly toned down.
MEPs in the committee also want to see a ban on the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in animal feed.
Shirly Karvis and Janni Huss wore identical evening dresses in the mission finale .
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says she got the dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals, who found me a gorgeous dress for this evening", Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening gown was also chosen by host Shirley Karvinen.
The twins themselves also noticed the similarity of their outfits and laughed at the situation.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomat that he was in a hurry with the preparations, and he had to get ready on the plane.
Hussi will be the backstage and red carpet host for the mission finale, and he'll be interviewing the arriving A-list celebrities.
Huss recently moved from Kamp to Jätkäsaari.
I'm going to stay there for now, see what happens.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own study, Hussi reasoned.
Before moving, Hussi vacationed alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I just stayed in a hotel for a week and never left.
When the stress got out of hand, I caught a cold, but otherwise the vacation was very successful", Hussi says.
Shirly Karvis 's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention , garnering curious stares from senior citizens .
Host and 2016 Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen said on the red carpet of the Miss Finland final that she had enough to do with radio broadcasts and Love Island Finland filming.
It's been so busy that Karvinen arrived at the final straight from a Finnair flight.
I did my makeup and my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
I'm going home to change. Hairy's laughing.
Karvinen says she pulled off her makeup in front of the senior citizens.
His preparation did not go unnoticed by his fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I could see people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was fun, at least in the eyes of others.
The furry one flies to Spain once a week.
In the Marbella, he stays for a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his job as the host of Love Island Finland.
He also describes his experience so far as "stopping".
Karvinen says he went to see the singles on the show on Friday.
It's really raw in a way.
These are real human emotions. Karvinen is describing the feelings of the singles on the show.
How do I put on the over-generational boots?
Three Perfect Examples of Dress
Classic garments are items of clothing that function from season to season in costume or outfit.
Often, the classics are decades old, but sometimes more modern individuals can be included.
The superstar boots that became the hit of the fall and winter seasons a few years ago have not gone away.
True to their name, over-the-knee boots are stylish year after year and season after season.
Showy boots divide users, but bold designs are worth trying, well... boldly.
You see, over-the-knee boots go with just about any outfit.
Whether jeans, lace, tights, or leotards, a simple leather or synthetic upper will do.
Long boots look good in formal wear as well as casual wear.
Black oversized boots go well with even delicate outfits.
They perfectly balance the femininity of a pink, flowery pleated skirt with a soft, voluminous sweater.
It's a fresh, yet autumnal, casual look with a romantic twist.
A strong and slightly retro outfit is created by a long copper brown velvet dress, high-end boots, flashy earrings and a riveted purse.
Although high-tech boots have a certain sophistication, they are also perfect for casual everyday wear, along with a T-shirt, long shorts, and even a trendy hat.
It's so easy and yet so elegant.
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and take on passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
The robot cars in Otaniemi will act as a bus simulator, as a robot bus is to be launched in the area next spring.
The project will develop and pilot year-round robotic vehicle traffic and test the technical performance of the vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The experiment is designed to see how the robot cars will fare on today's roads.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop the technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, head of traffic management.
For the first time, robot cars will drive completely automatically in traffic without special traffic controls.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the passenger assistant in the vehicle.
Vehicles constantly sense their surroundings with a variety of sensors and assess whether the road ahead is clear.
If not, they interpret whether the obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle, or a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, executive director of Sensible 4, which develops robot traffic.
The robot cars will run three days a week throughout the fall: Tuesdays from 1 to 3:30 p.m., Wednesdays from 10 to 3 p.m., and Thursdays from 10 to 3 p.m.
The robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
You can tell where the robot cars stop by the stop signs.
The safest place to get on is Bus Stop 1 in Otakaari.
The bassist of the band Mokoma fell off the stage in the middle of a concert and was injured .
The Mokoma band informs on their Facebook page about a surprising situation at the Packahuone concert in Tampere.
The Mokoma band's concert at Tampere's Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band's bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was playing the last song of the night.
He's got a broken wrist.
The band is announcing the news on their Facebook page.
"We are alive!"
Last night at the Depot, Santtu tripped on the stage during the last song and broke his wrist.
Let's wish a speedy recovery to our metal brother!
The rest of the tour will be handled by a back-up crew, the website says.
Mokoma fans are responding with concern to a photo update of bassist Santtu lying in a cast on the bed.
This is the news we've been waiting for. We were pretty worried about how bad it was.
It's a great relief. Fortunately, the bones heal with time.
A quick and speedy recovery to Santtu and a good tour to the rest of the band plus the understudy!
And thank you for last night, it was a great show, but promise me you won't have this much drama about ending shows in the future?" writes one fan.
Police monitored hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Police Department of Eastern Finland carried out hunting control on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, police officials reported on social media on Saturday.
The main emphasis of control was on the legality and legality of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and a permit to hunt on government land.
In addition, possession licences for hunting weapons and the permitted number of rounds of ammunition for semi-automatic firearms used for hunting were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were checked during the inspection and only one hunter was found to be without the required hunting licence.
The hunter was fined 12 days for poaching without a permit.
In addition, 133 drivers were questioned, including two on suspicion of drunken driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in the context of a fine procedure.
In summary, hunters comply very well with the hunting licence.
A lot of hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter commented that "in 50 years of hunting in the area, this was the first time anyone had checked permits".
The Police Service of Eastern Finland will continue hunting supervision in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian refugees
MEPs in the committee also call on the Commission and the Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the EU's external borders are fully respected.
Finland has decided to accept 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Selection visits are usually organised twice a year and include representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police.
The delegation is already in Turkey conducting interviews.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, this has meant people who are considered to be particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, the disabled and sick, women and children.
More people than the quota are selected for the group coming to Finland, because in practice some do not arrive for various reasons.
Mr Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and NGOs working on the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Chief of Staff at the Ministry of the Interior, is also travelling with him.
There has been talk of increasing the quota.
Finland has been taking in quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota was set at 1 050 a year for a couple of years, but since then there has been no agreement within the government to increase it.
The Coalition has supported an increase in the quota, but the project has recently fallen to the resistance of the blue.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to 1 500 to 2 000 people a year.
This is the first visit by a Minister of the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
Former Interior Ministers Petteri Orpo (Centre) and Paula Risikko (Centre) were able to take up their new posts before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
♪ Now we're going astray ♪ ♪ Don't know whether to laugh or cry ♪
Last Saturday, Karelian reported on a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article gave the impression that the draft law prohibits in principle the keeping of all animals not specifically authorised by ministerial decrees as farm animals, pets or otherwise in connection with business activities.
In other words, everything else is prohibited in principle, except for the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If this bill becomes law, it will mean that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger public safety or good practice.
We are now in the process of laying down a general ban on all activities not specifically authorized by law or regulation.
The change means that nothing new can be tried, for example in business, and nothing else can be done until the law or regulation approving it has been passed.
In general, the government's legislative activity has been weak.
If we now go down the road that basically everything is forbidden in Finland that is not specifically permitted, we will no longer know whether to laugh or cry.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act needs updating.
But a bill along these lines has no place in a democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it accepts this 'everything which is not expressly permitted by law or regulation is prohibited' procedure.
I hope there will be some sensible minister who will stop this kind of bill from going ahead.
Metti Forssell has a tip for the four most fashionable skirts this fall .
This fall's trending item is a snake.
It looks especially good in skirts.
Pair a snakeskin skirt with a more modest top, such as a polo shirt or a plain T-shirt, to keep the ensemble stylish.
Silk is in abundance this fall, and the silk skirt in particular is one of the season's trendiest garments.
Pair a gorgeous silk skirt elegantly with a feminine top or casually with a sweater.
With a silk skirt, you can play with something more daring, such as sneakers or the trendy cowboy boots of autumn.
Whether gray, brown, or multicolored, all plaid skirts are now part of every woman's must-have fall wardrobe.
Feel free to combine different colors and play with the size of the squares, including different sizes of tops.
For example, the combination of square and spherical is beautiful.
Asymmetrical hems are a breeze of summer lightness that you can take with you into the fall.
The asymmetrical hem is at once feminine and playful, perfect for everyday wear and festive occasions.
Baby Alexia, three months old, sulking sweetly in Jere's arms.
In the Karalahti family photo, the sweet three-month-old baby Alexia takes center stage.
Nanna Karalahti tells us about the Aito day care centre founded in Kerava.
Sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and ex-ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, had a baby at the beginning of July.
The couple's first son, Jax, turned two in May, while little Alexia is only a three-month-old baby.
Nanna Karalahti and Martina Aitolehti recently held a training camp for trainees in Marbella, Spain, with Karalahti's entire family attending.
Nanna posted on Instagram a picture of the Spanish atmosphere, in which the whole Karalahti family poses.
The children, Jax and Alexia, are in the arms of their parents.
The focus is on the sweetly sullen baby Alexia, resting in the arms of Father Jere.
Appreciate this.
Grateful for kindness, forgiveness, people's generosity and joy, Nanna Karalahti writes next to the family portrait.
Nanna Karalahti and ex-ice hockey player Jere Karalahti recently went into the daycare business and opened Aito Daycare for Kerava.
In addition to Karalahti, food expert Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisanantti, who is responsible for education, are involved in the company.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the head of the day-care centre.
In Turkey, people are advised to charge their cell phones in case of a storm.
Zorba, which struck Greece on Saturday, is expected to move into Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists on Saturday warned sailors, fishermen and farmers along the country's western coast about the storm in Greece, reports CNN Türk.
A tropical storm is expected to move up the coast from south to north later today.
As of early Saturday evening, disaster and emergency authorities urged citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm and to ensure that the Internet connection was working so that people could receive real-time updates on the situation, local news agency Anadolu Ajansi reports.
People have been advised to stay indoors and away from windows and to move outdoor items such as garden furniture out of the wind.
Heavy rain is forecast in Turkey with winds of 28 to 33 meters per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning for the southern Greek regions of Attica, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades, and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were advised to follow weather forecasts and the advice of local authorities.
A little while ago, when I made contact, there was a lot of wind and rain.
People were completely calm, communications manager Laura Aaltonen from Tui travel agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described a similar situation on Saturday night.
By evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages from Finns in distress.
In Greece, several ports were closed to shipping on Saturday, reported the local news agency Amna.
Boat trips to the sea were canceled on Saturday, travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and sea traffic were expected.
Finnair said on Saturday that it was actively monitoring the weather.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason why Mercedes is better than Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen had to admit that his main rival Mercedes was too much for him in the Russian GP time trial.
But there's no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, according to the experienced driver.
They were just faster than us, but it's no big deal.
"Our car was the best in qualifying all weekend so far, but they were just too fast", said Räikkönen.
Ferrari already had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
The youngster was asked what caused his sudden fall from a Mercedes.
They seem to be going faster than we are. It's as simple as that.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably be going the same speed as them.
But I don't know any more about it than anyone else.
This is always a guessing game, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In the off-season, we saw a rare treat for Räikkönen's future Sauber team.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Räikkönen in his first season with Ferrari, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also qualified for the final time trial.
For the Swedish driver, 10th is his best finish in more than three years.
And even though in the second session, as many as five drivers didn't race at all, it was still a tasty result for Sauber.
And perhaps an encouragement for Grumpy for what lies ahead?
Yeah, compared to where they were at the beginning of the season, it's been a big step up.
Next year's a different story, so we'll see, we'll see.
That was it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erka Teper.
The match between Robert Helenius and Erka Teper in Stuttgart went smoothly.
The German was more proactive in the ring, but he didn't get many good shots in.
Clearly superior, Helenius controlled the fight with his hard punches that landed well.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical shape than Teper.
The decision finally came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked Teper out with a left hook.
The blow was so severe that the veteran, fighting in front of his home crowd, did not even try to get up from the mat.
Once victory was assured, Helenius vented his frustrations with relative restraint.
In the ring interview, he first praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then he switched to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all the viewers and the Finnish fans.
We brought the belt today.
Helenius rejoiced immediately after the match.
It was a huge victory for Helenius' career.
There might even be a chance to get to the World Cup match, Helenius commented to Iltalehti before the match.
Instead, a loss could have ended his boxing career.
Of course it's crossed your mind.
You're not getting any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster could multiply
According to The Guardian, the country's vice president is warning of a sharp rise in the death toll.
According to the country's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could be in the thousands.
Difficult circumstances
Rescuers are searching for trapped people as well as bodies in the worst-hit areas of Sulawesi island: the port city of Palu and the neighboring municipality of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palu, but the situation in Donggala is still unclear.
Hundreds of people are still missing and about 540 are seriously injured.
There are still people trapped in collapsed buildings that rescue workers have not been able to get out.
For example, the Roa Roa Hotel in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers report hearing screams of people trapped in the rubble, but a lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of rescue efforts.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the military to help with rescue and cleanup efforts.
The military and its equipment are needed, since power and communication lines are down in many parts of the disaster area.
Fuel supplies are also running low.
Miss Finland finalist's hesitant answer and long reflection caused a roar of laughter
Billnäsi Ruukki is currently electing a new Miss Finland.
During the interview round, each of the mission finalists was asked a question.
The finalists drew a question from a glass bowl on the stage.
Especially the hesitant response of finalist number six, Emilia Anttikoski, 23, drew sweet but good-natured laughter from the audience.
The question to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
One user, Pirkko-Ella, wanted to know what was the last book the Miss World finalist had read.
Anttikoski considered his answer for a good while before hesitating.
Thank you for asking, Ella.
"The last book I read was"... said Anttikoski thoughtfully.
A pause for reflection brought a roar of laughter from the audience until Anttikoski continued his answer:
The last book I read was...
I've read books in school!
Probably something to do with economics.
So the last book I read was Economics Somebody, Anttikoski answered.
After his answer, Anttikoski received loud applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier, Anttikoski attracted attention because she did not want to pose in her underwear because of her principles.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 21:00, when last year's Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm will give up the crown.
That's why the apple-pear pie is so tongue-in-cheek.
This recipe is for those of you who have good, sour apples of your own, for domestic apples fetch outrageous prices.
You might have to buy a pear, although I think a lot of people already have a pear tree.
This cake can also be made with apples only if you do not want to buy a pear.
Of course, the flavor will be more varied if you include the pear.
Peel the apples and pears and remove the seed pods.
Sliced up.
You can melt in a pot.
Whisk the eggs and sugar to a frothy consistency, then add the cornmeal and melted butter.
Combine cornstarch, or maize, and baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Cover the baking sheet with baking paper, spread 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the sheet, and spread pear slices over the sugar.
Spoon half the batter over the pear slices and the apple slices over the batter.
Spoon the rest of the batter over the apple slices.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is a beautiful brown.
Let it cool in the pan and then pour it into the serving tray.
Don't cut the cake until it's properly cooled.
The cake has a brittle texture and crumbles easily because the dough contains gluten-free almond and corn flour.
Rukka is hosting an international crime literature event in January.
In January, an international literature festival focusing on Nordic crime fiction will be held for the first time in Kuusamo.
The programme of Nordic Noir consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary performances as well as jazz music.

In addition to the Swedish names, the event will also see guest authors from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Max Seeck will represent Finnish authors at the event.
According to the organizers of the festival, the northern location, nature, dark season and unique environment of Kuusamo provide the framework for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Analyzing the matter, researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two types of "coolness" with slightly different characteristics: the generally attractive coolness and the somewhat opposite dissident coolness.
Attractively cool people were described by the researchers as having many socially desirable traits: they were outgoing, friendly, agreeable, and competent.
Dissenters, on the other hand, were characterized by aloofness, independence, rebelliousness, and bitterness.
They were thirsty for experience and cared little for outside evaluation.
Both types combined high self-esteem and emotional stability.
Being a tough guy isn't cool in the long run: high status in your teens doesn't necessarily translate to success later in life.
This is according to a 2014 study published in the journal Child Development.
Young people who dated at an early age, went to parties, associated with good-looking people, and sought the approval of others were at greater risk of drug abuse and delinquency as young adults.
In their relationships, they fared worse than their once inconspicuous peers.
Luxury cars, designer handbags or high-status watches do not make a person cool - or at least genuinely attractive to be around.
In a study published in August in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, the majority of people were more willing to befriend someone wearing a plain store shirt than someone wearing a designer shirt - despite the fact that most chose to wear a designer shirt when getting acquainted.
If you are on a Greek island, beware!
There 's a hurricane headed this way . The weather alert is in the red .
During a weekend, southern Greece may receive as much rain as Finland receives in an average of six months.
Hurricane Zorbas is set to hit Greece this weekend.
Be prepared for this if you are in the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades, or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the embassy, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning for the areas.
The approaching storm is also being reported on the Foreca weather service blog.
It says the storm's strongest gusts will be up to 150 feet per second.
By comparison, the storm Kuisma that struck Finland earlier this week had maximum sustained winds of over 100 feet [31 m] per second.
However, according to the blog, the biggest concern about Zorbas is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
Over the weekend, southern Greece could see more than 300 millimeters of rain.
This corresponds to about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm's progress on its Facebook page.
Hurricane Zorbas has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the Love Island Finland Duck that men are drooling over?
Appears in some disturbing YouTube videos.
Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series, the beautiful Anku, who is drooled over by several men, also appears in strange Youtube videos published in 2010 as a crafting aunt.
In the videos, Anku teaches craftsmen how to make an octopus from an old roll of paper towel.
Anku also shows in a sympathetic style how to make a hedgehog out of pantyhose with real thorns growing on it.
Now let's make the Easter grass grow, but let's do it in a surprising way, Anku hints and shows sawdust, pantyhose and reed seeds from which he makes herring.
You can watch the videos below or on Anku's Youtube channel here.
With Valtteri Bottas shaking and bursting with adrenaline at Sochi, will he be Hamilton's backup on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was still shaking slightly ten minutes after his pole position in the Russian Grand Prix when he was in front of the media.
The great lap left behind Mercedes' number one star Lewis Hamilton and was certainly important mentally for the Finnish rider who has also collected criticism this season.
Have a good tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the deciding round.
I feel good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas came through.
I've only been to the stake once this year, in Austria (in midsummer), so it's been a while.
This track has been good to me in the past, and I got some good laps again.
It's not easy to overtake on the Sochi track, so the start is particularly important.
And, of course, Bottas had to answer the question of whether he was going to race for the win tomorrow or whether he was going to chase Hamilton for the world title.
My starting point in this race is absolutely to try to win.
When you start from pole, you can't have any other goal. Bottas has the pole.
But as a team, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis has quite a big lead over Sebastian Vettel, and the gap to me is very big, so that's something to bear in mind.
"Let's see what happens", Bottas added.
After the race, Hamilton was genuinely happy with Bottas' success, and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff was pleased too.
Lewis had every intention of beating Valtteri, but he failed in turn seven.
Valtteri knows he'll have to pull out all the stops to beat Lewis.
And he was so pumped up, the adrenaline was pumping out of his ears, Wolff was cheering.
Asked if the team would allow Bottas and Hamilton to race fairly, Wolff dodged the question.
We'll talk about it in the morning and see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen of Finland won the Finnish Rally Championship
It was a very unusual finish for the World Rally Championship.
Hardly ever before have brothers become Finnish champions at the same time.
In the final rally around Turku and Salo, Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen from Tuusula won the SM1 and SM2 classes respectively.
Erno Kinnunen from Kite secured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final race sealed him the Finnish championship for two-wheel drive cars in the SM4 class.
Kinnunen, competing in a Honda Civic, and map reader Ville Mäkelä started the Turku race in moderation, because the starting points were clear: placement in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the pair had to settle for a draw when some of the auxiliary lights failed in another special test.
You had to aim pretty blind for the third reel.
In a situation like this, you don't want to get sloppy.
On Saturday, only Jussi Tepo, who was second in the series, was watched, Kinnunen said.
Syria demands that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their troops.
The Syrian Foreign Minister is demanding that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
The European Union calls on all parties to the conflict to refrain from violence and to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria.
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end in sight to the seven-year war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
MEPs in the committee are calling on the Commission and the Member States to take the necessary steps to ensure that the directive is implemented as soon as possible.
Not quite the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court drama on TV.
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual harassment, drew an unusually large audience.
In the United States, at least 20 million people tuned in Thursday for the full- power drama of the Supreme Court nomination.
At that time, Donald Trump's nominee, Judge Kavanaugh, and the California professor who accused him of harassment, Blasey Ford, were in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell their stories.
According to preliminary results, the six main channels, ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, had a combined audience of 20.4 million.
They were joined by several million others who watched the hearing online.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people watched the livestream, and CNN reported that it set a record for the year with 8.2 million livestream starts.
CNN's figure jumps to over 10 million when you include YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million downloads.
The digital launches are owned by the channels, the TV ratings come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen's releasing the final numbers on Monday, but they're still off the charts.
Rare to reach 20 million
In the United States, viewership of more than 20 million is usually limited to sporting events and the major entertainment events of the Oscars and Grammys, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and, in 2016, presidential debates.
America's most-watched annual event, the NFL championship game, the Super Bowl, is a long way off.
This year's Super Bowl drew an estimated 103 million viewers to NBC.
Last year, Trump's first address to Congress was watched by nearly 48 million people, according to Nielsen, and his inauguration was watched by more than 30 million.
It 's a matter of the utmost importance .
The appointment of a Supreme Court justice is an extremely important event in the United States, since the position is held for life.
Trump was already able to nominate one new justice when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and Republicans successfully blocked then-President Barack Obama from nominating his successor.
The second vacancy occurred when Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement earlier this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on many issues he was the so-called swing vote, able to swing the nine-member court.
He was a supporter of abortion rights and the rights of sexual minorities and decided, for example, in 2015 with his vote that same-sex couples had the right to marry throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative in his views.
His selection to the Supreme Court could lock in conservative supremacy for decades.
Children have the right to have their information shared with their parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can access their children's health records on the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, and it's wrong, and it's weird.
Initially, of course, the situation with Kanta was even more worrying: parents were not even allowed to see their infants' medical records or prescriptions.
This situation led to a temporary correction in autumn 2016 for children under 10 years of age.
Since then, promises have been made to improve practices, but it has taken a surprisingly long time.
Now it's scheduled to be repaired in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the change of legal basis should have been no more than a slap on the wrist.
Then, in layman's terms, it is the pushing of a button.
Of course, a child can show his information to his parents - if he has bank numbers or an official identity card.
But how many 10-year-olds do?
There's a fee for an ID card, and bank codes aren't even available to a 10-year-old.
In practice, therefore, no one can see a fourth-grade school report unless he asks for a printout.
It's not so much the parents' right as the children's right.
Parental involvement is vital to the child's care.
Of course, the teenager's right to privacy must be respected.
Even minors may have family situations in which not all matters can be discussed freely.
Often they relate to sexual health, the free exercise of which is a profoundly significant human right.
In the United States, the FBI has begun to dismiss harassment allegations against Kavanaugh.
According to US media reports, the FBI is investigating allegations of sexual harassment by at least two women.
One of the women testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations that he sexually harassed her while she was a student.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
I don't want this investigation to take more than a week.
According to the Washington Post, the investigation is more limited than a criminal investigation and may not be made public.
A man threatened to kill police officers at a police station in Kajaani.
When the rioter was caught, he continued his rampage even at the police station.
Police say they've taken the man into custody to "calm him down".
Police were threatened by a suspected assailant on Saturday night in Kajaani.
Authorities are reporting an incident that began when a man in his 30s got into a heated argument at a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another customer inside the health food store.
This led to his dismissal from the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man, knocking him to the ground.
When a third party tried to intervene, he hit her as well.
A triple assault led to the police being called.
The patrol caught the man and took him to Kajaani police station, police said.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
A man kicked another officer in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the officers.
Police say they've taken the man into custody to "calm him down".
The man is suspected of three counts of assault and resisting arrest.
Aid agencies prepare to start work in Sulawesi, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent need"
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other international aid agencies are ready to help the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, says Kirsi Haru, UNICEF's communications manager in Finland.
Local authorities are leading the rescue effort, but the need for additional assistance is already evident.
Unicef is active in almost every country, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to its normal activities, UNICEF is always fully prepared to respond to emergencies, says Haru.
The first task now is to find the people in the rubble, both the survivors and the dead.
Rescue efforts are under way in the town of Palun on Sulawesi, but the situation is less clear in the Donggala area a little further north.
There's still places we can't reach.
Relief efforts are difficult because roads are also blocked, says Haru.
Buildings in Sulawesi are often of light construction, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami was great.
Once the survivors are located, they'll need shelter - tents, for example, at first - and clean water.
In times of crisis, clean water is the most urgent need.
The first step is usually to provide people with water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in stock.
Efforts are made to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported to the first-aid post by trucks, for example.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
Tracing and reuniting families is one of UNICEF's missions.
Food aid is provided by the World Food Programme (WFP), an agency of the United Nations.
In the early stages, emergency aid is financed from previously raised funds.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already begun to raise funds to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk is stepping down as chairman of Tesla after being fined $20 million for tweets.
Space rocket and electric car company founder Elon Musk is avoiding fraud charges by striking a deal with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk resigns as chairman of electric car company Tesla and agrees to a $20 million fine.
Musk is stepping down as part of an agreement he made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
By cutting a deal, Musk is avoiding fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission threatened Musk with securities fraud over tweets he sent in August.
In it, Musk wrote that he was preparing to take electric car company Tesla private, which sent the company's stock soaring.
According to the settlement, Musk is barred from serving as Tesla's chairman of the board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new 'independent director' to its board of directors and add two 'independent directors' to its management team.
Tesla must also form a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Musk will still be allowed to stay on as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal $20 million fine, Tesla will also have to pay a $20 million penalty to the SEC.
The tweets were misleading to investors.
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private again.
According to the billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought out of the stock market for $420 a share.
Tesla's stock shot up more than 10% in the 24 hours after the tweets, but then dropped.
According to the SEC, there was absolutely no basis for Musk's claims.
According to the Monitor, he had not in fact negotiated the alleged financing.
Nor had he discussed withdrawing from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the board of the company.
On Friday of this week, the stock plummeted 14 percent after the SEC announced fraud charges.
The deal is expected to put the company back on track.
The Last Judgment Is Not the Cause
Naturally, the cathedral bells do not ring when the hands do not move.
It's a technical fault.
The clock on the tower of Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The hands are pointing at 12 o'clock.
It's like being in a mediocre horror movie, except you hear an exorcism from the crypt of a church and the organ plays itself.
Of course, this is not the case; the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it is broken.
It has been checked by a repairman, but a part has broken and a new part is expected, says Eveliina Jamesen.
At the same time, James confirms what the Church in Helsinki Twitter account has already mentioned.
You see, the account states that the Last Judgment is not the reason for the clock to stop.
James says the church bells aren't ringing because of a malfunction.
