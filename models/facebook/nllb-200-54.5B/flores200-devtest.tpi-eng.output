This suggests that some dinosaurs did indeed have feathers, a popular theory that provides information not available in the fossil record, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists describe the animal's fur as chestnut-brown above and pale or carotenoid-colored below.
The study also sheds light on the origin of feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had two distinct structures - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis was a late development.
The researchers believe that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the 'sample' shows that it belongs to an adult and not to a juvenile.
The researchers believe that although this is the tail of a juvenile, it indicates that the feathers of adult birds are less abundant than those of juveniles.

The official announcement referred to border disputes, with the Palestinians preferring the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed in the report include the status of Jerusalem as a holy city and the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a ten-year military presence in the occupied territories when the agreement was signed and the PA agreed to eliminate such military presence within five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control test are supervised by rangers, as the test is monitored for effectiveness.
Through a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers are recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage Mick O'Flynn and the NPWS, the fourth shooter selected for the first shooting operation received "excellent technical guidance and training.
Martelly swore in the nine members of a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) this week.
This is Martelly's fourth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the former CEP resign as part of the country's move to new elections.
The commission is part of Martelly's response to the nationwide anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure of elections, some of which were scheduled for 2011.
For example, there have been 60 reports of iPods malfunctioning due to overheating, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 incidents involving the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "'minor'".
The ministry voiced its opinion by calling Apple's delay in reporting "outrageous".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Emergency Management reported no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also issued a tsunami warning.
A Filipino former policeman arrested Hong Kong tourists when he boarded their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Some of the hostages were rescued alive and six of them were killed.
Six of his hostages, including children and elderly people, were released first, along with the Filipino cameramen.
A camera crew poses as a middle-aged woman who is about to use the bathroom when Mendoza is shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone was sufficient to accelerate fetal lung development.
Xinhua reports that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two black boxes containing the plane's flight data recorder.
Other wrestling teams expressed their sympathy for Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna left us on the night of her two-month anniversary.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna does weird stuff like me...maybe better than me...love her and miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 conservative respondents in the 2010 election, those who favored Australia becoming a 'republic' increased by 8 percentage points from 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a "republic" after Queen Elizabeth II leaves office.
Thirty-four percent of those polled felt that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic immediately, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The gold medallist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness complaints made it uncertain whether he would compete.
He had been unable to obtain the drugs he needed to ease his pain because they were banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime on January 25.
Several hardware and software tests have been conducted since early February and were announced on Tuesday.
It seems likely that the comet's impact would have produced liquid water and other organic matter that could have supported life.
Scientists are trying to understand the formation of the planets, especially the formation of the earth, from the impact of comets in the distant past.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He describes idle talk as "the language of politicians and the language of fools".
He was widely expected to run for president again in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to direct aircraft and provide accurate information to pilots.
No other public transportation or subway will stop at Wembley, and the park-and-ride lot will not open.
The lack of transportation made the game seem like a game played in a no-go zone.
A study recently published in the journal Science provides information on a new "species" of bird that inhabits Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report the appearance of a new 'species' in two generations, but this longer process is thought to be the result of interbreeding between the Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into various shapes and rolled into bars.
It can be drawn into thin strips of wire, twisted and knotted, pounded with a hammer, or rolled into sheets.
It can be ground into a fine powder and bonded with other metals, and it is sometimes used to decorate handpainted pictures and illuminated manuscripts.
You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice is sensitive to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The amount of hydrogen (the H in pH) 'ion' in the test chemical will indicate the pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, damp hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The fluid in your hand reacts with the outer layers, where it produces a special type of cell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every home, and the sewers were connected to an unusual sewage system.
Archaeological evidence of such 'sewage systems' has been found in buildings from the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets date back to ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Roman world, they were part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you make a call thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the call and relays it back, instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere deflects some of the light that reaches our eyes.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] long is used to launch a telescope into space.
The wheel has revolutionized the world of transportation, and one of its greatest contributions has been to make it possible for us to travel faster than ever before.
He gave us trains, automobiles, and many other means of transportation.
At the bottom of the food chain are medium-sized cats that feed on everything from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many domestic cats that feed on insects, rats, bats, and birds.
The secret of their survival lies in their niche, a specialized role each cat plays that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are social cats that live together in large groups called prides.
Prides usually numbered from one to three men, including at least three women and children.
Female relatives, such as an extended family of sisters and their daughters.
Lion prides function much like packs of wolves or dogs, which resemble lions (but not other big cats) not only in behavior but also in aggression toward their prey.
A skilled athlete, the tiger can climb (with some difficulty), swim, leap, and pull objects with up to five times the strength of a human.
The tiger belongs to the genus Panthera, along with lions, leopards, and jaguars - the only four big cats that can roar.
The tiger's "roar" is like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but it sounds almost like a gasp.
The ocelot's preferred prey is small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds - almost all of which are smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists believe that ocelots, which hunt by scent, pick up scents where they have been in the world.
In addition to their excellent night vision and slow movement, ocelots find their food by camouflaging themselves in the environment and by hovering over their prey.
When a small group of animals (a relatively small number) moves away from the main population (e.g., to a mountaintop or a stream, or to a new island and finds warmth on the way back), it finds itself in a new and different environment.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different ways to grow beyond its previous size.
The rest of the population remained unchanged, but they would need to make the same environmental adjustments as before.
After some time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, becoming slightly different from other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be too different to be classified as one 'species.'
We call this process speciation, which means the production of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable and important step in evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants make their food in the sun by photosynthesis and provide shade.
Plants provide us with shelter, clothing, and most of our food; without them, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurs, the most feared predators of their time, were invulnerable to predators other than other mosasaurs.
Its mouth is equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, including an extra set in the roof of the mouth, which minimize the likelihood that the prey will escape.
We cannot be sure, but it probably had a forked tongue and lived on trout, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly even humans.
It will eat anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would be no match for it.
Although many of their pastries are familiar to us, the Romans had unusual foods or special celebration foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a species of dormouse.
Another oddity was that while the common people ate their kaiakia while sitting on couches, the rich preferred large banquets where they slept on their sides and ate.
The ancient Romans did not have the American or Asian foods that came to Europe a few centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and none of the ancient Romans ever roasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a first temple for each of their gods, which served as the deity's residence.
People would bring offerings to the gods, and the priests would try to fill the gods' needs during ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an outer sanctuary and an inner courtyard where only the priests could go.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built in the shape of the roofs of temples.
At the top of the tower are several shrines to the deity.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing is not a luxury.
Much of a Hebrew family's life was spent outside the home.
Women cooked outside the home; stores had open counters facing the street.
In the land of Canaan, forests were scarce and timber was expensive.
According to Norse mythology, Greenland was discovered and named by Erik the Red, who was banished from Iceland for murder, while traveling westward.
Even so, there were already Eskimos living in the area.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian,' Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland have much in common in their peoples, rulers, customs, and history.
If you have ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think of a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, the reverse is not true - a document may have writing on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
The "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" appears at the bottom of the Declaration of Independence, upside down.
While the identity of the scribe is unknown, it is known that the parchment document (293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safe-keeping when new.
Hence, it is likely that the later text was intended to serve as a 'label.'
The D-Day landings and other battles had liberated northern France, but not the south.
Other areas were occupied by the "Vichy" French, French citizens who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers rather than fight against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, American and Free French troops were liberating southern France and advancing into Germany.
A civilization is a culture dominated by a large group of people who live and work together, forming a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also refers to the size of a society.
City-states are the building blocks of a nation. Within a civilizational culture, knowledge is passed down from generation to generation, leaving a cultural footprint.
Small cultures often disappear quickly without leaving evidence of their history and are not recognized by historians as true 'civilizations.'
During the Revolutionary War, the states first established a weak central government - of which Congress was only one component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to tax, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, relies on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
Nor does it have the authority to change tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the consent of all the states before they could be amended and the states were given a central government, so the elected bodies did not exist.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, are two of the best national teams in the world and were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are popular in the northern regions, and Italy participates in international games and Olympic events.
Consisting of some 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), Japan is the seventh-largest island in the world.
Because of its group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago"
Taiwan came into existence in the 15th century when European sailors passed by and recorded the name Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post on the southwestern coast of Taiwan, initiating a grain revolution by employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, soldiers of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized the 'western' and 'northern' coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings along the perimeter of the structure have been reconstructed to give tourists an idea of what the structure looked like in ancient times.
By 1976, 80 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most popular still image photography format is 35mm, which is the largest film size since analog film.
It is a modern invention, but even more important is the aspect ratio adopted by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format, which can be confusing, is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get a smaller whole-number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are identical or nearly identical to this aspect ratio.
The widely derided rule of thumb is a simple guideline for producing a good photograph that includes a few lines of text.
He suggested that the ideal position for a subject is where the image is divided vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
The Catholic Church, with its wealth and power, was under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, this Christian religion held Europe together despite its linguistic and cultural differences.
From the least of them even unto the greatest of them, every one is given to covetousness.
One of the fundamental beliefs of Christians is that their money and resources should be used wisely to help others who are in need or who are starving.
After a millennium of domination by Rome and the wealth and power it wielded, many began to wonder if the church could ever live up to such expectations.
Shortly after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The plan worked, cutting off military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated international law established under the treaties of two centuries earlier.
Britain's use of minefields in international waters to interdict shipping in international waters also created a hostile environment for the shipping of noncombatants.
When this tactic failed, Germany feared the same fate for its U-boats.
During the 1920's, a growing number of citizens and nations were pursuing peace, unity, and independence.
Nations that had seen the horrors of World War I wanted to avoid a repetition of such atrocities.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had an elaborate system of timekeeping; each Chinese 'stage' or ruling family was a 'dynasty'.
One of the best-known examples is the 60-year period known as the Three Kingdoms, which occurred between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Those were turbulent times for many of the powerful and influential families struggling for control of the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the most violent in ancient Chinese history, with tens of thousands of people dying in a struggle for supremacy in the great palace at Xi'an.
Many social and political developments, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, and the rise of nationalism and patriotism, are the result of the will of the people rather than the will of a single ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, jobs were opened up to all, allowing dreamers and workers to pursue their dreams.
Similarly, in the military, ranks are no longer assigned according to social class but according to personality and ability.
The French Revolution inspired working-class movements in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was interested in more than the physical aspects of life and would go to a cave called "Hira'" on the Mountain of "Noor" (Light) to meditate.
The cave, which still exists, gives a clear picture of Muhammad's beliefs.
It is located on one of the hills to the north of Mecca, the world's best-kept secret.
Of course, it is not easy to find out whether it exists or not.
All you can see is a clear sky surrounded by majestic mountains, and you cannot see or hear the earth from a cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of a series of pyramids built to honor a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is dotted with pyramids (the largest being the great pyramid), tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" is in the shape of a V and the "down bow" is in the shape of a staple or a square without a bottom.
'Up' means to start from the 'tip' and push the bow, and 'down' means to start from the 'frog' (where the bow is held) and pull the bow.
An 'up-bow' produces a softer sound, while a 'down-bow' is more aggressive and has more bass.
You make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed 'bowing marks' are there for a reason and should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the women's markets escorted King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, back to Paris from Versailles.
They were hurried back to Paris in a carriage when they were surrounded by an angry mob shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The enraged crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the windows of their carriage open.
On one occasion, a man in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been executed at Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The cost of the U.S. occupation of the Philippines was borne by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to finance expenditures and interest on bonds used under the name of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
There is no doubt that the economic gains made or lost by the Filipino people will be used by the U.S. to dominate the rest of the world.
To understand the Templars properly, we need to understand the background of the group.
The High Middle Ages was a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended about 1500.
Technological determinism is an area of philosophy that encompasses a wide range of theories and practices, from the technological push or technological imperative to a view that human behavior is determined by the laws of science and the development of technologies that obey those laws.
Most definitions of technological determinism include two main assumptions: one is that technological development follows a pattern that is culturally and politically unchangeable, and the other is that technology creates "sense" in communities because these are innate human tendencies that technology does not produce.
The automobile, for example, has made possible the development of roads.
However, a transcontinental highway would save money because of the limited number of cars, so new methods of transportation were developed to reduce costs.
As more people have cars, the number of accidents on the roads will likely increase, prompting the development of new technologies in the medical field.
Romanticism included a strong element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
According to Romanticism, local customs and habits developed over time, reflecting local sensibilities rather than the arbitrary rules of a foreign culture.
Thus, while Paris became the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople became the fashion capital of medieval Europe.
It is known to many as the cradle of civilization from 400 A.D. to about 1100 A.D.
By the 12th century, its value had been greatly reduced by the return of the Crusaders, who brought gifts of silk and spices far more valuable than those found in Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title 'Fashion Capital' was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The dress was originally influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of the time-consuming nature of transmission, Western styles will be obsolete in 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, 'western' Europe had begun to develop its own styles.
Subsistence agriculture is the practice of growing food for one's family.
Subsistence agriculture is a system of low-input, low-pollution, locally grown food production combined with crop rotation or other low-impact farming techniques.
Subsistence farming was once the norm and still is in many developing lands.
Subcultures are groups of like-minded people who feel alienated from society's standards and who collectively develop an identity.
Subcultures can vary greatly in terms of age, ethnicity, social class, location, and gender.
The characteristics of subcultures can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture may identify with certain styles of dress, behavior, and speech.
One of the most widely used methods of demonstrating the ineffectiveness of socialization is the use of stories of children who have been socialized because of parental neglect, traumatic experiences, or abuse during their formative years.
Some 'lost' children are kept at home by a group (often a foster family) and are not allowed to have contact with their parents because of a mental or physical disability.
'Lost' children are those who have suffered some kind of trauma or 'trauma' in the past as a result of escaping or being separated from their parents.
Other 'feral' children include those who claim to be protected by wild animals; others claim to be isolated in the wild.
When cared for by animals, these 'feral' offspring often display characteristics (where possible) similar to those of their human caretakers, such as fear or social awkwardness.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding does more.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool that provides support to individual students who are learning a new skill, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real classrooms, i.e. a teacher is a scaffold, but a paperclip man in Microsoft Office is also a scaffold.
Computerized scaffolds are built into software and are used to ask questions, make suggestions, and explain procedures that are difficult for students to do on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and exploitation.
No child deserves to live in an environment that is unhealthy, uncaring, and uninformed, but it is.
We viewed the Foster Care System as a safe haven for these children.
Our Foster Care System is designed to provide children with a safe environment, loving and caring parents, and quality health care.
Foster care often involves giving a child everything he or she did not have at home.
The Internet combines one-on-one conversations with group chats.
These trends provide new insights into how the Internet can be used for entertainment.
For example, "'learning' and 'socialization'" are important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"'Personal involvement'" and "'continuing relationship'" were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivations for using the Internet when studying social networking behavior.
The use of video recordings has enabled researchers to study the effects of microexpressions, facial movements that occur within milliseconds.
More important, it has been suggested that we can detect deception by accurately interpreting a person's microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, shows how people with brain damage are unable to decipher speech even when the speaker is telling the truth.
He also suggests that such observations could explain the behavior of humans and domestic animals like dogs.
Twentieth-century research had shown that there are two 'pools' of genetic variation: the latent and the manifest.
Mutation creates new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination transfer the variation between the two pools within each generation.
In the savanna, it is hotter than a primate with a digestive system like a human's to extract amino acids from local plants.
In particular, failure to do so can have serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and even death.
The protein in the leaves and seeds of the host plant is too hot for primates like us to break down and burn.
In addition, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are easy to digest and provide high levels of protein, which contains all the amino acids needed by the body.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if their ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the practice of waking up in the middle of the night and returning to sleep within 10 to 60 minutes.
This can be done by using a quiet alarm clock that wakes you up gradually rather than abruptly.
If you find yourself 'resetting' your alarm clock in the middle of the night, moving it to the other side of the room may encourage you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink plenty of fluids (such as water or tea, a diuretic) before bedtime, which will force you to get up and go to the bathroom.
The level of peace that exists within a person is connected to but opposite to the level of distress that exists within a person's body and spirit.
The fewer the problems, the more positive aspects there are to life.
Enlightenment is open to all, and the only thing standing between us and it is our own negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded to include the mahayana path of love as well as many of the techniques of Indian Yoga.
At its core, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Along with Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy ('enlightenment energy') is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Central to Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and mental enlightenment occurs.
Germany's role as an international adversary in World War II led to the formation of the Soviet Union and the United States.
Within two years of the end of the war, the Allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It would last 40 years and be fought out on the battlefields of Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense collapsed, and the only solution was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, those plans were thwarted that night when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Third Army invaded and formed a front in Belarus and a front in Ukraine after invading and occupying the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements between the two countries and many others.
Shipping is the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods or people at sea.
The navy's job is to ensure that your country is able to move its goods and people and to prevent the enemy from doing so.
A recent example is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the United States tried to move men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean in support of Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, with its U-boats, tried to prevent this.
If the Allies failed to act, Germany might invade and occupy Britain as it did all of Europe.
The domestication of goats began about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Early cultures and tribes adopted them for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were herded into groups that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often under the supervision of 'goatherds' who were the adult offspring of shepherds.
Wagonways originated in England in the 16th Century.
Although the wagonways consisted of planks laid side by side, the horses that pulled them moved faster and pulled heavier loads over roads that were less rough than those of the day.
Initially, crossties were used to hold the rails in place, but it was later discovered that the rails could be made more efficient by adding a metal surface.
This was a common practice, but it resulted in wheel wear.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767, the first all-iron rails were built.
The first form of transportation, walking, began about two thousand years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning 'upright man').
The earlier Australopithecus did not always walk on two legs.
Bipedalism is found in the fossil record of Australopithecus from 4.2 million to 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to make peace with the environment, we can join an environmental movement, and we can become activists to reduce the impact of climate change.
Often this is similar to symptomatic treatment, but if we do not like the appearance of a mole, we need to identify the cause of the problem and eliminate it.
He observes that the world has changed greatly as a result of advances in science and technology and of the increasing problems associated with overpopulation and high living standards.
After the document was received by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy, signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to a nearby printing shop owned by John Dunlop.
Between 150 and 200 copies of what are now known as the Dunlap broadsides were produced.
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon outside Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
Twenty-five Dunlop broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Most paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs still survives today.
Most people would not think of them as dinosaurs because they had feathers and could fly.
Yet, birds have much in common with dinosaurs.
It had scales and claws, laid eggs, and walked on two legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today convert information into binary code.
A binary number can have two values, 0 or 1, and these are called binary digits - or bits in computer language.
Internal poisoning is not always readily apparent, and symptoms such as fever may be more serious when prompt diagnosis is not possible.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning is an open container of a toxic chemical in the home.
Check the label on the first-aid kit.
The term 'bug' is used by entomologists to describe this group of insects.
The term comes from Bed-bugs, the insects that infest humans.
Assassin bugs and bedbugs that are 'nidiocolous' live in their natural habitat or food source.
In the western United States, there are an estimated 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among adults.
MS is a disease of the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not in their best interests.
Such couples may decide to give the baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the adoptive parents terminate the custody of the child.
The goal of science is to discover how the world works by applying the scientific method, which guides most scientific research.
Unlike experimentation, where an experiment is a test used to disprove one or more hypotheses, questioning and experimentation also provide the basis for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers often consulted classical texts, such as the Latin Bible.
They accepted Aristotle's views on science, including psychology.
As Greek learning declined, the West drifted away from Greek ideas in science and philosophy.
Many researchers have observed that biological rhythms and behavior in animals and humans are regulated by circadian rhythms and biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not occur naturally, have been observed in many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-reproducing electrical circuits that operate in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of many that suggested that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were performed in which the DNA in the phage was replaced with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein was replaced with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can produce a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the function of the genetic material, and whether the cells are germ-line cells.
Mutations that occur in germ-line cells can be passed on to offspring, whereas mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
'Nature-based tourism' attracts people who are interested in natural areas and enjoy the scenery, flora and fauna of the area.
Examples of on-site activities include fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
Take, for example, a trip to Borneo to photograph and learn about orangutans.
Each morning, as people from the countryside take the bus to work, they greet one another by exchanging greetings.
The transportation shuttle links communities and supports a transportation system based on the private car.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of the stable state that has supported humans for the past two million years.
All members of society use transportation systems, and most people have complaints about them.
In the 'developed' world, you will not hear similar complaints about the quality of water from collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis, are transportation engineers simply not up to the task, or is something more serious going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they react to one another.
However, the study of traffic flow is complicated by the unpredictability of driving.
However, drivers tend to behave in a consistent manner, so traffic patterns have certain consistencies that can be expressed mathematically.
To improve traffic flow, three key factors must be considered: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relays help in the planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, using flight to avoid predators and to find food and peaceful companionship.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings close to their body.
As a result, they have many small places to hide from predators.
Today, insects that do not fold their wings include dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the solar system revolved around the sun.
While some people believe that he is correct, many hold the opposite view; they believe that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
This seems logical, since we cannot actually feel the earth move.
The Amazon River is the second-longest and the largest river on earth, carrying eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's largest river, measuring six miles in diameter.
Twenty percent of the planet's water supply comes from the Amazon.
The mighty Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of tributaries.
Although pyramid-building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, it never matched the size and skill of the Giza pyramids.
The pyramids were more than a thousand years old when the Egyptians of the New Kingdom thought that their ancestors had built something extraordinary.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest sovereign state in the world and the most sparsely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Official Italian was also used in everyday speech and Latin in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
The chemical elements gold, silver, and copper were known to man in ancient times because they were found in the environment in their 'native form' and were easily extracted with primitive tools.
Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to (and in the same order as) the four 'states of matter': energy, liquid, gas, and plasma, which are also said to undergo chemical reactions.
Alloys are compounds made of two or more metals - not to be confused with the many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, but there are others, such as silver and gold.
You can have alloys that contain trace amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, which is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of a sentence.
As a result, the pencil has been a valued companion for most of its life.
With the development of new writing systems, however, the pencil was relegated to a minor role.
Nowadays, people write information on computer screens without ever touching a sharpener.
Consider what will happen to keyboards when a new feature is introduced.
A fission bomb is a device that uses the law of conservation of energy to produce a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
Nuclear fission releases some of this energy, like pushing a heavy object up a steep hill.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they can break apart with little or no electrical charge.
The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
Its crust is about 45 miles [70 km] thick at its nearest point and 60 miles [100 km] thick at its farthest.
It is 'thin' under 'maria' and 'thick' under 'highlands.'
It is more likely that there will be more lava nearby because the crust is thinner and it is easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what makes people feel or think.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and desires that are hardwired into them from birth.
These theories focus on what causes people to act or not act according to their preferences and their environment.
Two well-known content theories are the Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Overall, two trends emerge when managers take on leadership roles: on the one hand, they want to be "one of the boys" (the girl in the group).
Such a manager often finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, punish wrongdoers, evaluate performance, delegate tasks, and point out errors.
A manager, on the other hand, becomes so popular that he or she feels compelled to change everything about the team and to do everything themselves.
After all, it is the leader who determines the success or failure of the team.
This creates tension between leaders and teams.
Computer-supported teams may have the same standards of efficiency as office teams, but there are subtle differences.
Computer-supported cooperative teams often serve as the glue that holds office teams together.
They can exert more control over in-office teams by meeting with team members at convenient times in different time zones that local managers cannot understand.
A true "'invisible team'" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is the phenomenon of computer-based collaborative teams.
The "invisible team" is a management team to which each team member reports and to which each team member contributes.
Why would an organization want to do a time-consuming task? This is the process of creating a learning organization. One of the reasons for organizational learning is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity flourish when the various departments of an organization pool their resources.
As a result, an organization's process of working together to solve a problem can evolve into new and different processes to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as a culture of sharing and learning.
Angel (2006) defines the Continuum approach as a method used to help an organization achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, thus narrowing the field of research to the exact sciences.
The relationship between brain pathology and funding for scientific research.
It has long been known that brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors can cause behavioral and mental changes.
These new technologies allow us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that we could not see before.
This provides us with new information and material for creating 'simulation models' that can help us better understand the processes that take place in our mind.
Although AI is reminiscent of science fiction, it represents a fundamental flaw in computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and modification of a machine.
Research in AI is the process of making machines perform tasks that are routine and require specialized knowledge to make decisions.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, answering customer questions, and recognizing handwriting, voice, and facial expressions.
Each of these features its own study area, focusing on ways to help the elderly to cope with everyday problems.
This AI system is now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has been used to create some home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are an important part of the classroom, and teachers often want to take their students to places where they cannot take the bus.
Technology provides teachers with computer-based field trips, where students can explore museum artifacts, an aquarium, or a work of art while sitting in a classroom.
Storing a field trip on a computer is also a good way to visualize a trip and share the experience with the afternoon class.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the State Capital, and each year the website is redesigned, but the old versions remain online as a scrapbook.
Often, students start their blogs with poor grammar and spelling, and they improve as they gain readership.
Since students are more likely to speak up when something is wrong, the student who writes the blog will try to avoid comments that say otherwise.
Blogging also "forces students to become more aware of what is going on in their communities". This need to meet the needs of their readers makes students more knowledgeable and "interesting" (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that encourages students to take what they learn beyond a typical school day.
Using blogs in a positive and constructive way "can allow students to make judgments about what is appropriate and inappropriate; when using online materials, students can learn where they stand in relation to what others have written and can also express their views on current events (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's bilingual capital and home to art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Far to the south are Niagara Falls and to the north is the scenic Musoka Plain.
Outside observers say that all of this and more makes Ontario the very essence of Canada.
The vast areas farther north are sparsely populated and contain some uninhabited villages.
A demographic fact that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
Eastern African Islanders who live in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is one of the world's largest, and it is a continent unto itself in terms of wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are either independent or part of France and are luxury beach resorts.
Islam, also introduced by the Arabs, became the dominant religion in Comoros and Mayotte.
European ideas and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Route on his voyage from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.
For wives: It is good to mention that you are married, even if you are not.
It is advisable to wear a ring (not an expensive one).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, often involving physical contact, holding hands, and the like.
Say no firmly, and do not be afraid to speak up.
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as an important port called Anfa.
Destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt as Casa Branca, it was abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultans rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and Spanish traders renamed it Casablanca when they established trading posts there.
It was one of the worst shopping areas in all of Casablanca.
In the old Medina, it is easy to find shops selling Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and geegaws, all of which cater to tourists.
Goma is a popular tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of Congo on the eastern border with Rwanda.
In the summer of 2002, the Nyiragongo volcanic eruption devastated Goma, flooding many of the city's streets and swelling the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, tourists visiting the countryside outside the city should be aware of the fighting in North Kivu.
The city is home to and claims the Nyiragongo volcano as well as the Mountain Gorilla Conservancy, the most lucrative conservancy in Africa.
You can use a border-crossing (motorbike taxi) to travel within Goma. The local price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Another factor is that "Timbuktu" has a tropical climate and is often used as a metaphor for something exotic, far away.
Today, Timbuktu is a modest city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, with a harbor.
In 1990 it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger because of the destruction of its desert sands.
It was one of the stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS program Wonders of the African World.
Unlike any other city in the country, it looks more like an Arab village than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern corner of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers some 7,500 square miles [19,500 sq km] and is divided into 14 ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is considered an integral part of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there is a conservation and daily entrance fee.
It is advisable to purchase a Wild Card, which grants admission to parks within South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a popular tourist destination.
Hong Kong's skyline has been described as a 'bar chart' of Victoria's waterways.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across the river to Kowloon.
The bulk of Hong Kong Island's development is concentrated along the north shore of reclaimed land.
This was the birthplace of British colonialism, and it is a good place to start if you want to see evidence of the colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching some 50 miles [80 km] into Bangladesh and deep into coastal India.
Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Sundarbans is part of the Indian territory known as the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangroves and swamps - they contain some of the last great forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 1,400 square miles [3,850 sq km], of which one third is wetland.
In 1966 the Sundarban was declared a wildlife sanctuary, with an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the 'inter-district bus station' (located on the other side of the river) during the day, although most, for those heading east to Jakar/Bumthang leave the station between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by the popular Japanese Coaster Buses, and you will feel right at home.
Shared taxis are a convenient and quick way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 279 feet [83 m] above the ground, are 1,260 feet [378 m] long, and each has a 12-foot-wide [3.5 m] double-deck.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to open in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints will be abolished.
The Guarani, a powerful indigenous people who live in what is now Eastern Paraguay, are nomadic herders and farmers.
The Chaco region is also home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunt, fish, and gather forest products.
Paraguay, the "Giant Province of the Indies", was founded in the 16th century by Spanish conquistadores.
Three centuries of Spanish rule followed.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has maintained many of the customs and traditions of its indigenous groups.
Argentina is widely recognized as having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The main tournaments of the year are held in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Small tournaments and games are also held here four times a year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo matches, check with the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Islands' currency is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds can be used throughout the island and Stanley credit cards also accept U.S. dollars.
In remote islands where credit cards are not accepted, although British or U.S. currency is acceptable, check with the shopkeeper to see what options are available.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency across the islands, so you should exchange your money before leaving.
Because of its location south of the Equator, Montevideo alternates between summer and winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures can reach over 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winters can be bitterly cold: temperatures do not drop below freezing, but air and moisture in the atmosphere combine to raise the temperature above the thermometer.
There is no such thing as a "winter" and a "summer": the amount of rainfall remains about the same from year to year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to humans, they are wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed by humans.
Park officials recommend that visitors stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from other wildlife!
Although they may appear peaceful, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can become aggressive.
Each year, thousands of visitors are injured because they do not keep a safe distance from these large, oily, and potentially dangerous animals.
Also, beware of odors that attract bears and other animals, and avoid handling or cooking food that has a strong odor.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
This "harbor" was the site of a famous battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All but one of the British cruisers were sunk, with the loss of about 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, an event took place in the town in which the "paramount chief" Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III died.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is flanked by two harbors, and the best and most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shores (in the North Harbour district) stretch along the Pacific Ocean from Long Bay in the north to Devenport in the south.
Most of the beaches are safe for swimming and many are shaded by pohucawas.
The Tamaki Drive waterfront is located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket communities of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are often crowded with families and are known for having good shopping nearby.
The number one local song, 'Number One,' is a simple, yet beautiful, and heartwarming song.
French wines were plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines were more readily available.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid of tap water.
Unusually for Australians, a flat white is an espresso, a cappuccino with cream (not foam), and a short black is a tea with no milk.
The 'hot chocolates' on the Belgian stand are mainly fruit juices, but they are excellent.
Reefs are visited regularly throughout the year, and casualties are rare.
Instead, check with authorities, obey all signs, and read and follow safety warnings carefully.
Box jellyfish regularly appeared along coasts and estuaries during the nighttime from October to April in 1770, and occasionally they appeared outside these times.
There are sharks, but they are not man-eaters.
Saltwater Crocodiles do not live in the sea all the time, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Choosing a destination ahead of time gives them peace of mind that they will have somewhere to stay when they arrive.
Travel agents often work with individual hotels, and you may find that you can use a local agent to book accommodations or other facilities, such as campgrounds.
Travel agents offer deals that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or a combination of airfare and hotel rates.
A reservation may be made for you if you need time to consider an offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa).
Some changes or requests should be made through the travel agent rather than directly to the hotel.
On some nights, large numbers of musicians camp out there, and many feel that this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to move quickly and find a campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that while the music may have died down by now, there will be some late-night sessions that will continue until midnight.
Some cities have special areas for families with small children to camp.
If the Northern Baltic is crossed in winter, check the location of the cabin, as it can be very noisy in icy areas.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg provide time to explore the city. Cruise passengers do not need to carry a visa (see terms).
Casinos try to make the most of the time and money spent by their patrons, with no windows, no clocks, and few exits.
Special food, drinks, and entertainment are provided to keep the 'guests' happy and indoors.
However, drunkenness impairs good judgment, and as any conscientious gambler knows, it is an impediment to good judgment.
Driving at higher altitudes or in mountainous terrain is subject to snow, ice, and freezing temperatures.
On snowy or icy roads, the friction is much less than on gravel.
During a blizzard, snow that could freeze you may fall in an instant.
In addition, you may lose some of your vision when snow falls or ice forms on the windshield.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic flows smoothly year-round.
Safaris are perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The popular term 'safari' refers to a journey overland to see Africa's exotic animals, many of them from the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, prefer to be close to vehicles, and special equipment will give you a better view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy animals that can be seen with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "'bush walk", "hiking safari", or simply "'going on foot") is a walking expedition, lasting hours or days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the change was announced, you could be in for a very hot summer.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March most coronavirus cancellation policies had not been postponed to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most of the tickets will be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, so a standard ticket will cost about ¥7,000.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for use, even if no iron is visible in the room.
If an iron is not available or if you do not plan to wear an ironed sock, try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, fire).
To 'purify' the water, some water purifiers work to eliminate certain contaminants.
In some areas one minute of boiling is sufficient, while in others you may need to boil the water for several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and you should be cautious about buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar pests that damage clothing and food in their destination.
Pests can cause food poisoning, skin rashes, or worse - they can cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or spread disease from person to person.
The term "pestilence" does not apply to diseases that spread rapidly or to pests that deliberately kill people.
Duty free shopping is the practice of purchasing goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often cutting through sparsely populated and remote areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, brace yourself: there are steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
Speed limit signs are lower than other signs - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/ h) - and good manners are more likely to be ignored.
We don't know why cell phone service is better here than in many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are a delicacy, and in Bavaria they are as rich in cheese and cinnamon as those of southern Austria.
Fruit pastries are plentiful, and there are apple pastries available year-round, as well as cherry and plum pastries for summertime.
Almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts are a staple of German cuisine, and the most popular cakes are often accompanied by a strong cup of coffee.
If you prefer small pastries with a hint of sweet cheese, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish using herbs and spices, with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of water used.
In the regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is used in curries; in Southern India and some coastal regions, coconut milk is used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is just one of the many names for the variety of dishes found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used loosely, it refers to food from the 'central' and 'eastern' parts of Java.
Now found throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes seasoned dishes, the main ingredients of which are peanuts, chilies, sugar (the Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups were footwear that supported the rider's legs under the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but they can also cause safety problems because the rider's legs get caught in them.
If a rider falls from a horse while his legs are still attached to the stirrups, the horse can pull them away.
First, many riders wear riding boots with a smooth heel and a long sole.
Additionally, some saddles have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to slide down the saddle if a rider falls backward.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier rock-climbing area, known as the Yosemite of South America - is famous for its granite walls and cliffs.
The mountaintop offers spectacular views, and explorers from around the world are opening up new routes through the dense jungle.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular activities in which you slide down a slope with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a tourist activity in which groups of enthusiasts, known as "ski bums", plan a skiing vacation at a resort.
The concept of 'skiing' is ancient - there are cave paintings showing skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is similar to but not to be confused with alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter of which is practiced on steeper terrain and requires steeper skis and boots.
Think of a 'skiing route' as similar to a 'hiking route.'
With good coordination, you can cover longer distances by skiing rather than walking - but you will occasionally reach cross-country skiing speeds when you are not carrying a heavy backpack.
Europe is a small continent of many sovereign states, and travel between them often involves multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen zone, oddly enough, is sometimes a country unto itself.
If you are in this zone, you can cross the border and avoid the passport control checkpoint.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas in each of the Schengen member countries, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax agencies classify items that are more than 100 years old as such.
The answer varies from place to place, ranging from a lower life expectancy in North America to a higher one in Europe.
Handicrafts are classified as 'antiques,' even if they are not as old as other factory-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important occupation among the Sámi and its culture is also important to other groups who have other occupations in their communities.
In the past, not all Sámi were involved in reindeer herding, but they hunted, fished, and so on, often using reindeer as pack animals.
Today, many Sámi are engaged in secular work, and tourism is an important source of income for the Sámi people in the Sámi homeland.
Although widely used, especially among the Romani people, the term "Gypsy" is somewhat of a misnomer because of the negative connotations and stereotypes associated with it.
Depending on the country you are visiting, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may need to be adjusted.
You can also get information from governments that are not intended for you but for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East would be treated differently from Europeans and Arabs.
Advisories are brief reports on political developments in a country.
The information presented in this article is fast-moving, concise, and deceptively simple compared with that found elsewhere.
Severe weather is an ambiguous term that refers to weather conditions that cause damage, disruption, or death.
Depending on location, environment, and atmospheric conditions, extreme weather can occur in any part of the world.
High winds, excessive precipitation, and wildfire are some of the possible effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Examples of severe weather for each region are blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of regional weather patterns because they can affect travel plans.
Those planning to move to a war-torn country need professional training.
An Internet search for 'Hostile environment course' will turn up the address of a local company.
A course will round out the discussion and provide additional information, including some experiences.
One course would last two to five days and include role-playing, extensive first aid, and some weapons training.
Books and magazines about life in the country are plentiful, but there is little literature on war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad are required to present their valid documents upon their return.
The practice of issuing X-marked passports or documents certifying a name change from one sex to another varies from country to country.
Recognition of such documents by foreign governments is also unusual.
Security at checkpoints has increased dramatically since September 11, 2001.
Transgender people should not expect to be scanned and have their privacy violated.
Rip currents are ocean currents that flow away from the coast and then return, often to a reef or similar feature.
Because of the underwater typology, the returning water collects at the dive sites, and a fast current is directed to the dive site.
Many deaths are caused by drowning people trying to swim against the current, which is difficult to do.
Once you cross the current, swimming back will not be as difficult.
Try to swim to a place where the current does not pull you back, or swim at your own risk and wait to be rescued if you are spotted.
Re-entry shock is more immediate than culture shock (there is no honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe than culture shock.
Travelers who do not find it difficult to adapt to a new culture often find it difficult to reestablish contact with their own.
When you return home, you adjust to a new culture and give up some of your own customs.

Finland is a boating paradise - the "'Land of a Thousand Lakes,'" with thousands of islands in its lakes and seas.
On smaller islands and lakes, you may not need a yacht.
Small islands in the sea and the largest lake are large enough to accommodate a yacht or a kayak.
