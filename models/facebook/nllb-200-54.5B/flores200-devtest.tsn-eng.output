This not only indicates that, at least to a limited extent, some dinosaurs had wings, a widely held belief, but also provides an explanation for fossils, often without them, such as their color and shape.
According to scientists, the animal's wings were gray above and gray below.
These findings, in turn, provide information about how the wings of birds have evolved over time.
Because dinosaur wings do not have perfect spines, called rachis, but have other wing shapes - spikes and ridges - researchers conclude that the rachis was actually a development of the modern and other shapes.
The shape of the wings suggests that they were used, not for flight, but for thermoregulation, or visibility. The researchers said that although this is the tail of a juvenile, the mark points to the wings of the male and not the female.

According to an unofficial report, the document would deal with the issue of the borders, which almost all of Palestine is situated on before the 1967 Middle-East war.
Other issues discussed included the future of the land of Jerusalem, a Holy Land to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
The Israelis want troops along the river for ten years once the agreement is signed but the PA has agreed to only five.
The trawlers used in a supplementary experiment to control polluting emissions were monitored by conservationists, while the experiment itself was observed and its results analyzed.
With the cooperation of the NPWS and the Australian hunters' association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited through the sport hunters' association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Deputy Superintendent of Conservation and NPWS, the four blacksmiths selected for the initial firing program received extensive safety training and instruction.
Martelly swore in a new Provincial Electoral Council (CEP) executive, of nine members, yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended early retirement of CEPs as part of the roadmap to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests have been fueled by the failure to hold elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
At least 60 cases of iPod malfunctions due to overheating have been reported, resulting in at least six fires and leaving at least four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents linked to the devices.
Last week METI reported that Apple notified them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "minor".
The department responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "deeply disappointing".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 am local time (9.19pm GMT, Friday).
The regional emergency management office for the northern Mariana Islands reported no other casualties in the community.
Even the Pacific hurricane warning center said there was no indication of a hurricane.
A former Philippine police officer takes Hong Kong tourists hostage in a bus hijacking in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and more than half a dozen are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographer later substituted for the elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom.
Liggins then followed in his father's footsteps into the medical profession.
She trained as a midwife and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggings began to investigate premature pains during rest periods.
His research has shown that when the hormone is administered, it will cause the lungs of the fetus to expand rapidly.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two of the plane's 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also erected a memorial.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Extreme Lady. The first spirit guide. Luna died on the night of the two moons. That was so unlike her. That woman is crazy".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as eccentric as I am... perhaps more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people interviewed prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to a republican Australia had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The incumbent Prime Minister Julia Gillard said in a 2010 federal election advertisement that she believes Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's term ends.
Of those polled, 34 percent agreed - they wanted the Queen to be Australia's last monarch.
In a comparative opinion poll, 29% believe that Australia should become a republic in the near future, while 31% believe that it should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100- and 200-meter freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, his fitness was called into question.
He is still unable to take the medication he needs to ease his pain, as it is not allowed in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest integer that is not divisible by 25.
A number of people have verified this by computer in various ways, beginning in February, it was reported on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were one of the means by which water and other nutrients became available on Earth.
The astronauts hope to understand the formation of the planets, especially the planet Earth, since comets have collided with the Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year, and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the menafuna "political rhetoric, nonsense".
There are rumors that he may run for President in 2016.
NextGen is a program that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter distances while saving millions of gallons of fuel a year and reducing emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older ground-based position-finding technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint the aircraft's location with greater accuracy and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be brought in and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking services and car-pooling facilities are not available at the stadiums.
Fears of a lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the game may have to be played indoors and without fans.
Research published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species first appeared in just two generations, although the process is believed to take much longer, thanks to the crossbreeding of Darwin's king grass, Geospiza grass, and the mopane worm grass, Goespiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into a variety of shapes, from very small to very large.
It can be drawn on a thin sewing thread, or nailed or screwed to a block of ice.
It can be made so thin that it looks as if it were used to decorate the hand-painted illustrations in illuminated manuscripts.
This is called a chemical indicator. You can make a chemical indicator by using the juice of red cabbage.
The color of cabbage changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH is determined by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons separated from their electrons (in nature, Hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two types of flour, and with clean, moist hands, knead the mixture into small balls.
The water in your hand will come into contact with the outer surface, causing you to swell and not sink.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, which were connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of an elaborate sewage system have been found in Minoan mortuaries on Crete and Santorini in mainland Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman times, toilets were part of public baths where men and women mingled.
To make a long-distance call, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the signal and relays it back to earth, almost instantly.
Scientists use mirrors in space to block out light and vision because of the earth's atmosphere.
It takes a huge rocket more than 100 steps into the sky to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has made a huge difference in the world. The wheel's greatest contribution has been to make transportation easier and faster.
It has brought us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized animals such as rabbits, ferrets, and parrots.
Finally, there are the many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that feed on countless small creatures, such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is that communication, an activity that is vital to the cat's noncompetitive nature.
Lions are the most sociable of cats, and they live together in small groups called prides.
A pride may have from one to three males and as many as 30 females and their cubs.
The females, usually in pairs, form a large family of older males and females.
A pride of lions behaves much like wolves or dogs, lions (but not other big cats), and predators.
The athlete is very agile, the leopard can ride (but not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the mental strength of a strong man.
The leopard is a member of the same family (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
A leopard's roar is not as loud as a lion's roar, but it is almost as low-pitched.
The ocelot is a predator of small animals, including monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds, many of which are smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists speculate that wild cats track and locate potential prey by following their scent, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
The ocelot hunts by hiding in the surrounding area, and then it pounces on its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a relatively small number) becomes separated from their main group (as when they cross a mountain or a river, or when they move to a new island and cannot easily return) they often find themselves in a different environment.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new team needs different structures or adaptations to the new environment to be more competitive than it was before.
Mankind's original population has not changed at all; it still needs to adapt to the environment.
In time, as most of the group become accustomed to the new environment, they become increasingly isolated from other groups.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will be so different that they will no longer be the same species.
We call the process "Speciation". This refers to the creation of species. "Speciation" is the key process in the growth and evolution of living things.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants convert sunlight into food through the process of photosynthesis.
We use plants to weave cloth and build houses. Most of our food comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its mouth was studded with some 70 sharp teeth, and the presence of more in the jaws meant that nothing could escape.
We cannot be sure, but its tongue may have been forked, and it ate turtles, tadpoles, and other crustaceans, possibly including members of its own family.
It has also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although many of their dishes are familiar, the Romans had their own special foods for such occasions, including turkey, peacock, snail, and dormouse.
Another difference was that while shorter people and women ate seated, the rich tended to eat a variety of meals together, often reclining on one side while eating.
The diet of Ancient Rome could hardly have included foods brought from as far away as the Americas and Asia in later periods.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built elaborate temples, which were viewed as the dwelling place of that deity.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, while the priests tried to supply the gods' needs through ceremonies and feasts
Each temple had an open courtyard, with an inner sanctuary, to which only the priests could go.
Elaborate pyramidlike structures, called ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of temples.
At the top of the towers was a special place, for the gods.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not of great value.
Much of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open counters, facing the street.
Trees were scarce in Canaan, and timber was expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norse legend has it that "Erik the Red" was banished from Iceland by a murderous father; but as he traveled west, he discovered the land and named it Greenland.
Whatever his achievements, Eskimo tribes were already living in the area.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and early history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you can imagine that there is a treasure map printed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not necessarily a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" were inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although no one knew for sure who wrote it, it is known that originally this large leather document (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 pages), was folded up and preserved.
Hence, it is likely that the inscription was inserted merely as a seal.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was not free.
It was dominated by the "VICHY" in France, the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France, codenamed "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing toward Germany.
A civilization is a way of doing things that is intelligently shared by a large group of people living and working together, as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning society, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town, thus indicating the size of a community within a city.
Cities preceded societies. A civilized culture holds that knowledge is transmitted from generation to generation, a system of permanent and equitable diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without a trace, making them unrecognizable as whole peoples.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states began to form a weak federal government - a unicameral Congress - under the Articles of Confederation
Parliament had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or legislature, it relied heavily on state administrators, who were often uncooperative, to carry out its overall policy agenda.
Nor did it have the authority to change tax laws between states.
The articles required the unanimous agreement of all countries before they could be ratified, and the country's neglect of the central government was so great that its representatives were often absent.
The Italian national soccer team, along with the German national soccer team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, and roller hockey, as well as Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are popular in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international and Olympic events.
Japan consists of some 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's archipelago, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as the "island country"
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by and named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in southeastern Taiwan, revolutionizing the local grain industry and hiring Chinese laborers to work the sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and made Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, shortly after their defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which gave Japan control of the territory of Taiwan.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings along the lagoon have been reconstructed to give visitors a better view of their original appearance.
By the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common still-image format is 33mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analogue era.
It is still produced today, but more important is the visual impact of digital photography.
The actual 35mm format, somewhat confusingly, is 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The ratio of fractions of this form (divided by twelve to obtain the ratio of whole numbers) is thus stated as 3:2.
Many common shapes (the APS set of shapes, for example) are equal to or nearly equal to the fractional partition.
The rule of thirds that is most abused and often ridiculed is a simple guideline for creating a masterpiece while maintaining a certain balance in the picture.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the picture into three vertical and horizontal sections (see illustration).
During this period in European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years the Christian religion had united Europe despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-embracing power has affected everyone from the king to the lowliest one.
One of the fundamental teachings of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church coffers should be used for the same purpose.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church remained in Rome, and this concentration of power and money in one place led many to question whether this belief had any basis in fact.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began blockading the German navy.
This tactic proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated customary international law that had been endorsed by several international treaties over the previous two centuries.
Britain has dredged international waters to prevent any ships from entering all parts of the sea, endangering even neutral shipping.
With a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted naval warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing spirit among most peoples and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations were eager to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to America with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own unique way of marking different periods of time; each Chinese stage or dynasty had its own unique dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period of divided provinces, the most famous of which was the 60-year period of the Three Kingdoms between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
This period of time was marked by bitter struggles between various nobles for control of the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, with thousands dying in a struggle for supremacy in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the adoption of a system of weights and measures, the transition from dictatorship to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to all the people rather than to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, employment was opened up to all male applicants, enabling the more determined and successful to get ahead in life.
A similar development took place in the military, where military rank was now based on ability rather than social standing.
The French Revolution also galvanized millions of oppressed workers in other countries to rise up against their governments.
Muhammad was greatly interested in otherworldly matters. He would visit a cave called "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (Light) to meditate.
His isolation, which survived the times, was a clear indication of Muhammad's religious leanings.
Resting on top of one of the mountains to the North of Mecca, this cave is the most isolated in the world.
In fact, it is almost impossible to see it at all, even if you knew it was there.
Nothing can be seen but the clean, clear sky above and the surrounding mountains. Little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramids built to honor a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains a number of pyramids (of which the "Great Pyramid" is the largest), a number of smaller tombs, a number of temples, and "The Great Sphinx".
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The musical symbol for "up bow" is in the shape of a V, while the symbol for "down bow" is in the shape of a rectangle.
High means that you must start at the tip and push the bow; low means that you must start at the hock (where the hand is not holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The up-bow produces a low-pitched sound, while the down-bow is loud and clear.
You are free to make pencil marks, but remember that permanent marks are there for a reason, so they should be respected.
For six days in October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, along with Queen Marie Antoinette and their young children (Marie, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the king's sister, Queen Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by an angry mob of women in the marketplace.
Surrounded by an angry mob shouting threats against the King and Queen, they traveled back to Paris in a covered wagon.
The mob forced the King and Queen to leave the cabin windows wide open.
On one occasion a royal academy shook the head of a royal guard who had been executed at Versailles before the startled Queen.
The cost of the U.S. government's war of conquest was borne by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to finance a large part of the costs and interest of the real-estate purchases that were financed by the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Indeed, the huge profits made from exploiting the Filipino people make up a large part of America's gross domestic product.
To understand the clerical alliance formerly known as the Templars, one must understand the challenging circumstances that led to its formation.
The period in which the events took place is called the "High Middle Ages" - the European cultural period, centuries ago (AD 1000-1300).
The plague years were followed by the early middle ages and then the late middle ages, so that with changes they ended in 1500.
Technical determinism is an umbrella term covering various aspects of practice, as technology advances with the help of management theory, and as technology advances with the help of technical standards.
Most descriptions of technology have two basic assumptions: that technological development itself follows a path that transcends tradition or political influence, and that technology ultimately has "effects" on society as a whole rather than being socially transformative.
For example, one might say that automobiles led to the invention of roads.
National highways, however, are not economically viable with fewer vehicles on the road, so new techniques have been developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
More traffic means more accidents on the road, opening up new avenues of medical intervention to repair damaged bodies.
Eulogies played an important role in confirmation, drawing on such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
They tell us that in the ideas of romanticism, a place built people, over time local traditions were created, introduced, married into the place and its people, were superior to mere rules.
Just as Paris has become the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of medieval Europe.
Its popularity as a decorative ornament began about 400 A.D. and continued until about 1100 A.D.
Its reputation declined in the 1100's when "Crusaders" returned home with valuable gifts of silk and locks of higher quality than those available in Byzantine markets.
It was then that the name "Fashion Capital" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
Originally, the caparison was influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Yet, because of slow communication networks, western standards may be 25 to 30 years behind.
As the so-called Dark Ages drew to a close, the countries of western Europe began to develop their own styles of dress.
Ijeso farming is done by a farmer who produces enough food for himself and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses locally stored seeds combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
From that point on, most subsistence farmers farmed, raising livestock for food at home, and this has continued in many developing lands.
Subcultures unite like-minded people, who feel alienated from their communities by community norms and allow them to identify themselves.
Customs can vary according to the age, race, social status, location, and gender of the members.
Cultural differences may be linguistic, physical, religious, political, gender, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subcultural group often express their solidarity in subtle ways and manners, including dress, manners, and speech.
One popular way to illustrate the value of socializing is to look at a number of cases of children who, because of neglect, poverty, or severe abuse, did not grow up with social skills.
In some cases, biological neglect is the result of parents' fear of accepting the child's severe disability.
Feral children may have been severely abused as children or suffered from depression before they were abandoned or ran away from home.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the woods.
When raised exclusively by animals, a feral child displays virtually all the characteristics of its foster parent (as far as the body can tell), such as fear and indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding does more.
Scaffolding is not an educational philosophy, it is a tool to help students learn new things, like learning to use a loudspeaker or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be real or imaginary, in other words teaching can be referred to as a scaffold, like the wallet guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are designed to be networked to interrogate, alert, and explain systems that may be difficult for students to understand on their own.
In the warmth of the sun, they may experience a misty vision of water (or other substances).
No child deserves to grow up in an environment that lacks nurturing, attention, and education, but it does.
We feel that the Orphan Care Program is a safe haven for these children.
Our orphanage program should provide a safe home, with loving caregivers, a solid education, and reliable health care.
The orphanage should provide for all the needs that were lacking in their previous adoptive homes.
The Internet combines both public and private communication.
The unique features of the Internet lead to increased limits on what you can do with it and how you can satisfy yourself.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are cited as important motivations for using the Internet (James, et al., 1995).
"Personal care" and "relationship maintenance" were also identified as new areas of motivation according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they surveyed the attitudes of web audiences.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of subtle emotions, facial movements that last for millions of seconds.
In particular, it is said that one can tell if a person is lying by the way his facial features move.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to evaluate facts accurately.
He even suggests that such a capacity for inheriting human behavior can exist in animals such as dogs.
Research during the 1900's has shown that there are two distinct types of peace differences: latent, or hidden, and manifest.
A mutation creates a new genetic variant, but selection removes it from the pool of identified variants.
Separation and recombination alternate back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the grasslands, it is difficult for apes, with their humanlike digestive systems, to meet the amino-acid requirements of the vegetation.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences: developmental depression, malnutrition, and finally death.
A readily available plant nutrient would be the protein found in leaves and beans, but it is difficult for the human body to digest unless it is cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to eat but also rich in protein and essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way that seems similar to the way monkeys in captivity do today.
Sleep disruption is when you deliberately wake up at your normal bedtime and then go back to sleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be made easier by using an alarm clock that produces a low-pitched sound to keep you awake but not awake at all.
If you find yourself turning the alarm off while asleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other physiological measures include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is refreshing), before going to bed, so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner calmness a person achieves is proportional to the degree of nervous tension in the body of the individual and the visitor.
The absence of conflict is a sign of life. Everyone has the capacity for peace and happiness.
Everyone has access to enlightenment. The only thing that may hinder is our own impatience and discouragement.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but these were supplemented by the Mahayana form of Indian love and meditation yoga.
The beliefs of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple. They include Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
By means of Kundalini "Yoga", the kundalini energy, which restores posture, breathing, concentration, and vision.
The centerpiece of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. The more one meditates on the various gods, the deeper one's mental and emotional qualities become, and the thoughts of enlightened consciousness begin to emerge.
Germany was a common enemy of the USA and the USSR during World War II, which led to an alliance between the two countries. But after the war ended, differences in systems, institutions, and traditions led to the disappearance of international unity.
Within two years of the war's end, those former allies became bitter enemies as the Cold War began.
It would continue for 40 years, fighting with "paramilitary forces" in war zones from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish army, already defeated, was forced to retreat to a bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were soon shattered when some 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops invaded, blockaded Belarus and Ukraine, and, after invading the eastern part of Poland, violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other bilateral and international agreements.
Shipping is the most efficient means of transporting people and large quantities of goods across oceans.
The navy's job is to ensure that the world can continue to move people and goods freely; but at the same time, it interferes with the enemy's movement of people and goods.
One famous example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using U-boats to great effect, was trying to stop these movements.
If the "Allies" had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats seems to have begun about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient tribes bred them for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats are usually kept in herds that roam the hills or pastures, tended by boys or girls, much like traditional shepherds.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although made of planks laid side by side, the chariots allowed horses to run at high speeds, carrying heavy loads over the rough roads of the day.
Crosses were soon developed to hold the track in place, and it was found that the track would work better with metal overhead.
This became a common practice, and the iron rails broke the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first iron railway was put into operation.
The ancestor of the dog was walking, and humans began walking upright millions of years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, never walked upright.
The ability to walk on two legs has been traced to Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 million to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by becoming more environmentally friendly, joining conservation organizations, perhaps even becoming activists to try to lessen future suffering.
This is similar to treating the symptoms of a disease, not the disease itself. But, rather than looking for a temporary solution, we must identify the cause of the problems, and we must eliminate it.
It is obvious that the world has changed greatly as a result of man's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been compounded by overpopulation and a lavish life-style.
After approval by Congress on July 4, the unfinished manuscript, signed by Congress president John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the nearby printery of John Dunlap.
During the night, from 150 to 200 copies were printed, now known as the "Dunlap Papers".
The first public reading of the charter was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
Another was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he ordered read to the troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 surviving Dunlap papyri are believed to be the oldest surviving copies of a document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Modern scientists say that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Many people do not believe in owls because they have wings and can fly.
But there is more to birds like the thunderbird.
They have webbed feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today rely on the control of information encoded in binary numbers.
A divisor can have only two digits, such as 0 or 1, which are called divisors in computer language.

Throughout the Americas, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease of the central nervous system, made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies show that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
Couples may decide that it is in their best interests, or their child's best interests, to keep the baby.
These couples may arrange to adopt the child into their family.
When a child is legally adopted, the biological parents lose their parental authority to claim the child as their own.

Naturalists and scholars were especially interested in ancient texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Adopted are Aristotle's ideas in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, people in the Western world found themselves increasingly cut off from Greek scholarship and technology.
Many came to realize that almost all physical and moral phenomena are closely related to nature and how it changes over time.
Transient disturbances, not caused by external factors alone, have been well documented in most but not all microorganisms, plants, and animals.
The body's internal clocks are finely tuned to keep time even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is a genetic fabric.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
In two experiments, they labeled DNA with radioactive phosphorus, or phage protein, and radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause different infections depending on the type of mutation, the specificity of the gene involved, and whether the affected body cells are of the same cell type as the pathogen.
Only a mutation in a germ cell can be passed on to offspring, whereas other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts those who like to visit natural sites to enjoy the scenery, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird-watching, and visiting parks and learning about ecology.
For example, traveling, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns of their villages in vehicles to go to work and are different from others whose place of employment is their hometown.
In this highly developed transportation system, all passengers are connected to, and have access to, private transportation networks.
Science shows that modern life-styles have contributed to the pollution of the environment that has been the world's lifeblood for human civilization for the past two hundred million years.
Everyone has a role in society and everyone uses public transport. Most people complain about public transport.
It is rare to hear sincere complaints about poor water quality or collapsing bridges in the developed world.
Why is there so much dissatisfaction with public elevators, why do they fail so miserably every day?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one destination to another as well as the interaction between drivers.
Unfortunately, traffic investigations are a daunting task, since you can never be absolutely sure how a driver will react.
The advantage is that the response of the drivers is more or less uniform and consistent; thus, the weight of the vehicles on the road is uniform and can be calculated.
To get an accurate score on traffic congestion, three main factors are considered: (1) traffic flow, (2) vehicle weight, and (3) vehicle speed.
These relationships help in planning, building, and preparing roads
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to do so enabled them not only to avoid flying but also to search for food and to breed.
Many insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings over their bodies.
This means that they have plenty of places to hide from predators.
At this stage, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago a man named Aristarchus proposed that the planets revolve around the sun.
Some people believed that he was right, but most believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
This seems logical, for the earth does not sound like it is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on Earth, with a water volume eight times that of the next largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some places over ten miles [6 km] wide.
A full 20 percent of the planet's river water is diverted from the Amazon to the oceans.
The main stem of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of tributaries.

All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, have long been known to man, since they occur naturally and can be readily mined with primitive equipment.
The philosopher Aristotle came up with the idea that everything was made up of a combination of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): force, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also taught that they change into new states to form what we see.
Iron is actually an alloy of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
When law enforcement did not appreciate the magnitude of the threat, the Maryland Transportation Authority aggressively shut down the police station.
You can also have compounds that include small amounts of nonmetals, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that thousands of them could fit into the tiny space at the end of the line.
Thus, the pencil was a great companion for many when it first became available.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing systems, the pencil fell into disuse and disrepute.
People now type messages on a computer, without needing to hold a pencil.
One might wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to fuse a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Speaking on ABC's 7.30 report on Wednesday, Australia's Prime Minister, John Howard, admitted that if reelected in the next election, he would not complete a full three-year term as Prime Minister.
Other atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to explode with little or no compression.
The Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer part of the Moon is called the crust.
The crater, which is about 45 miles [70 km] deep on the near side, is about 60 miles [100 km] deep on the far side.
It thins out under the oceans and thickens under the hills.
There may have been more oceans on this side because the crater is narrower, making it easier for the volcanic ash to rise to the surface.
Content theories are based on what people find attractive and what attracts them.
These theories say that people have desires, which are implanted in them as they grow older.
These theories look at what makes people want to do what they do and how their environment influences what they do or do not do.
Two well-known theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Often, a moral dilemma may arise when a supervisor begins to dominate those who are already his peers. On the other hand, he may try to remain "one of them".
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking positive action, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, he becomes increasingly erratic, believing that he must change the entire system to reflect his new leadership.
Of course, the leader is responsible for the victory or failure of his team.
Many behaviors lead to conflict if we are not a leader and a team.
Small groups are treated with high expectations, as are normal groups, but there are differences.
Some gang members in the networks work to unite the real gang.
They tend to be more autonomous than traditional groups, which often meet according to rules not understood by their superiors.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1889, p109) is also part of the virtual team.
The "invisible group" is the administrative body to which each member is accountable. An invisible group sets the rules for each member.
Why would an organization want to make a time-consuming plan to establish an educational institution?
When existing resources are used effectively at all levels of the organization, innovation flourishes.
As a result, the movement for organization to work together to meet the challenge may lead to a new approach to innovation to meet the needs of the customer.
Before a company can innovate, its leadership must instill a spirit of innovation, together with knowledge sharing within the company.
Angel (2006), explained, whereas the "continuum" is a way to help organizations expand their service.
Neurobiological data provide tangible evidence of mental processes for cognitive investigation. Now, it expands the field of investigation and makes it more precise.
Scientific research confirms the link between the mind and behavior.
It has long been known that a variety of brain injuries, stresses, lesions, and inflammations affect behavior and alter brain function.
Advances in technology make it possible to see and probe the structure of the brain, including previously unknown systems.
This provides a wealth of information and building blocks that help us to understand the planning process in our minds.
Although AI is most closely associated with science fiction, AI is an important branch of computer science, focusing on learning and behavior in computers.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves designing machines that can automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples include, managing, strategizing, and punctuality. The ability to answer customer questions, recognize handwriting, voice, and face.
Such practices have developed into various forms of divination, which are used to help solve some of life's problems.
Al systems are now widely used in socioeconomics, medicine, engineering, and the military, embedded in home computers and in video games.
Class trips are an important part of every lesson. Often, a teacher may want to take his students to places that they unfortunately cannot visit by bus.
Students can explore ancient artifacts in a museum, go on a marine excursion, or sit in a classroom and admire works of art.
Sharing the trip online is also a great way to remember the trip and share your experience with future students.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the State Capitol, each year the website is updated, and the old ones are stored online as a workbook.
Blogs also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of other people often changes that.
Since students are often the most critical, the writer tries to write better to avoid criticism.
Social networking also "makes students smarter and more aware of what's going on in the world around them". The need to entertain audiences motivates students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing about something strengthens teamwork, and it encourages students to study more intensely than is usual during the school day.
Effective use of blogs "provides students with the ability to be introspective and active; by actively responding to online posts, students are able to take a positive stance toward others by writing and expressing their perspective on small issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's fascinating capital, a bilingual city with diverse artistic and cultural centers that reflect Canada's past and present world cultures.

In 2002 the area of Goma was devastated when mudflows from the Nyirango volcano covered the streets of the city, especially in the center.
Although Goma is safe, any travel outside of Goma must be checked to understand the situation of the ongoing war in the North Kivu region.
The town is a base for trekking Mount Nyiragogo; it is also one of the cheapest gorilla-watching trips in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (scooter taxi) to get around Goma. The standard fare (domestic) is ~500 Congolese Franc for a short leg.
Combined with inaccessibility, "Timbuku" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but despite its fame as a tourist attraction, it also has an airport.
In the year 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, because of erosion by the desert sand.
It was the site of one of the prime ministers' visits to a PBS special produced by Henry Louis Gates for international publications.
The town is quite different from all the other towns in the country, as it looks more Arab than African.

The Sundarbans has been declared a world heritage site by UNESCO. A forest reserve in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just wet mudflats, but areas that were once covered by thick, green forests.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by wetlands.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966. Today it is estimated that there may be 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 cheetahs in the area.
Buses leave from the regional convention bus terminals (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading west and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.

The Guarani were the largest indigenous group living in Eastern Paraguay, transient hunter-gatherers who were also subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was home to a number of ancient cultures, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who made a living by hunting, sporting, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Virgin Province of the Indies", came into being as a result of the contact between a group of indigenous people and Spanish conquistadores.
The Spanish began a period of conquest that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve its natural beauty with much of its history and identity.

The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Ransom occurs at only one bank in these deserts, this one, found in Stanley, across the street from the FIC West store.
British pounds are widely accepted on the islands and on Stanley credit cards, and U.S. dollars are also widely accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what forms of payment are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the island.
Located south of the Equator, Montevideo alternates between summer and winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the tropics; during the summer months, temperatures often exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winters can be treacherously cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but when wind and humidity combine, they can be colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
While most animals are accustomed to humans, wild animals are still wild animals, so humans do not feed them or bother them.
Zoo officials recommend that bears and wolves be kept at a distance of no more than 100 meters (100 yards), while other animals are limited to 25 meters (25 yards).
No matter how docile they may seem, buffalo, elk, bears, and almost any other large animal are vulnerable.
Each year, thousands of visitors are injured because they get too close to the animals, which are large, dangerous, and deadly.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid handling or preparing food that smells, and keep the camp clean.

Anyone coming to drive in areas far from the equator, or high up in the mountains, must take into account the possibility of snow, frost, or freezing weather.
On icy, snow-covered roads, car tires are less stable, so you cannot drive as if you were on gravel.
During blizzards, large amounts of snow can fall in a relatively short period of time.
The view may be obscured by falling or melted snow or by raindrops or frost on the windshield.
"On the other hand, snow and ice on the roads are common in many countries, so the weight of vehicles on the road remains relatively constant throughout the year".

The stirrups help to support the rider's legs, which hang down either side of the horse.
They keep the rider from falling, but there may be safety concerns since the force of a sound can knock the rider's feet off.
If a rider falls from a horse with his leg still attached to the saddle, the horse can drag him off the ground as it runs away.
First, most riders wear comfortable shoes with smooth, pointed heels.
Next, the saddle, especially for the carnival of the Little Mermaid, has secure stirrups with which to hold on to allow the footrests to fall back under the pull of the rider if he falls.

"Skiing" is an ancient pastime - there are artistic depictions dating back to 5000 BC!
The sport of skiing dates back to the 18th century - in 1861 some Norwegians opened the first ski resort in Australia.
Cross-country skiing: This is also known as bush skiing, alpine skiing, or alpine skiing.
It is similar to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although they are not exactly the same, which involve descending from a great height and require very sturdy shoes and equipment.
Think of a skating rink as being just like a hiking trail.
In good weather you will be able to walk long distances - but you will rarely see cross-country skiers without a heavy bag to carry on the paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent countries. Traveling through many countries usually means having to apply for more travel documents and paying more taxes.
The Schengen area thus becomes like a single country.
As long as you live in this area, you can cross borders without going through passport control again.
Thus, with a Schengen travel document, you do not have to keep applying for a visa in the Schengen member countries, thus saving time, money, and a lot of paperwork.
