This not only confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers but also provides information not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
According to the researchers, the animal's plumage was chestnut brown above and pale or carotenoid below.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a ruff but have other features of feathers - such as ruffles and feather rays - the researchers concluded that the ruff was likely a later evolutionary development.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for thermoregulation or for courtship.
Although it was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers presented the specimen as coming from the adult plumage and not the juvenile down.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team hoped to detect tidal effects between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon's gravity affects the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way's gravity affects the Sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy.
Scientists were able to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the galaxy's dark matter surrounds it in a kind of halo and is made up of a large number of tiny particles.

Voting in France has not traditionally been high-tech: voters lock themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope on which they have marked the candidate of their choice.
Once the identity of the voter has been confirmed by the authorities, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law is relatively precise in determining the course of events.
In 1988 ballot boxes were made transparent so that voters and observers could verify that there were no envelopes in the box when voting began and that no envelopes other than those officially counted and authorized were added to the box.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the proceedings, and in the evening the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to prescribed procedures.

The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions in Scotland, has indicated to journalists that it will not comment further, at least until charges are laid.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which the Palestinians want the borders to be as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other subjects discussed reportedly included the future status of Jerusalem, holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists on a continuous military presence in the valley for 10 years from the date of signature of the agreement.
The shooters participating in the complementary pest control experiment were to be closely monitored by the rangers as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Eligible volunteers were recruited as part of a joint project between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the NSW Shooting Sport Association of Australia, and as part of the NRA's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of parks and heritage protection for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shots received comprehensive safety and training training.
Martelly recognised nine members at yesterday's meeting of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth interim election council in four years.
Last month, a presidential-appointed delegation recommended the resignation of the previous interim electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The delegation was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government demonstrations that began in October.
The protests, which have at times turned violent, were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
Some 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the equipment.
Last week, the DOJ announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious".
The Department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the investigation "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
She trained as an obstetrician and joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins spent his spare time studying premature birth.
His studies showed that administering the hormone accelerates the development of the fetus' lungs.
Xinhua reported that an official investigation team found two black boxes, or flight recorders, on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. She was my first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe more... I love her and I'll miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Ahead of the 2010 federal election, a poll of 1,400 respondents found that the number of Australians opposed to becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled shared his view and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to remain Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes, 29 percent of the respondents think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic champion was scheduled to compete in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and three discus events at the Commonwealth Games, but his condition has been uncertain because of pain.
He has been unable to take the necessary pain-relieving drugs because they are prohibited in competition.
On January 25, mathematician Curtis Cooper, a professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Several people confirmed the discovery by early February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the earth formed, since comets collided with the earth long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo's term as governor began earlier this year, and last month he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political claptrap and ridiculous".
There's speculation he's gonna run for president in 2016.
The US Federal Aviation Administration claims that NextGen is a system that will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older ground-based radar technology, enabling air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional transport, no overground trains stopping at Wembley, and no parking or connecting parking facilities available at the venue.
Concern over the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the evolution of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that the new species evolved in just two generations - much longer than previously thought - through the interbreeding of a native Darwin's grasshopper (Geospiza fortes) and an introduced species, the cactus grasshopper (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes, and it can also be ground into smaller objects.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and spun, it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used in hand-painted pictures in books, which we call book illustrations.
This is called the pH of the chemical, and you can make your own using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the substance.
The number of hydrogen ions (pH H) in the test chemical indicates the pH value.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of crust.
Nearly every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had latrines, and in Roman civilization, latrines were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together in the same facilities.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket more than 100 feet long.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the fact that it's so much easier and faster to get around is the greatest thing it's done for us.
It has given us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them come the more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized game from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Then there are the many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, which are far more numerous.
The secret of their success lies in what has been called the ecological niche, the concept that each feline has its own specific function for which it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, and they live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males and sometimes up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave much like packs of wolves or dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, jump far, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family of big cats (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion but is more like a phrase made up of murmured, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, preying on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can catch them.
Researchers believe that the ocelot tracks and locates prey by sniffing the ground over which it has walked.
Ocelots can see very well in the dark, thanks to their night vision, and they move very unobtrusively, hunting by blending into their environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river or to a new island, so that it is not easy to move back), its environment is often different from what it was before.
The resources of the new environment are different and the competitors are different, so to be a strong competitor the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all, but still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the main population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of a new species, and speciation is a necessary consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and use the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Plants produce their food by harnessing the sun, and they also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was the great predator of its day, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Over 70 razor-sharp teeth protruded from its long jaws, and an extra row of teeth in its mouth ensured that nothing got past it.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex couldn't have done it.
Most of their foods would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own strange or unusual feasts, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called the nutcracker.
Another difference was that the poor and the women ate their meals sitting on chairs, whereas the rich preferred to have communal banquets where they lounged on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not accommodate food that only in later centuries came to Europe from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a main temple that was viewed as the god's home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, called the Most Holy, where only the priests could go.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built over temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of a Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, and shops were just open counters along the streets.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the island was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776".
No one knows for sure who wrote them, but it is known that in early times a large parchment document (measuring 29 3⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) was rolled up for preservation.
So it is likely that the inscription was simply added as a sort of name tag.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was occupied by the so-called Vichy France, the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fight them.
The Allied invasion of southern France, code-named Operation Dragoon, began on August 15, 1944.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civilian or citizen, and it's related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen or subject, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it also sort of defines the size of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture refers to the transmission of knowledge from one generation to another, a long-term cultural footprint, and a high degree of diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving the necessary historical evidence, so they are not usually considered true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - the only part of which was Congress - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, lacking a national executive or judicial branch, had to rely on the often uncooperative state governments to enforce all its laws.
It also lacked the power to change tax laws and customs duties between the states.
Amendments to the articles required the unanimous approval of all the Länder, and the latter were so arrogant toward the central government that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful national football team in the world after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians even compete in international competitions and the Olympics.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), Japan is the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because the islands of Japan are clustered or grouped together, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in a geographical sense
Taiwan became known as early as the 15th century when European sailors passing by referred to it as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in native grain production methods and hiring Chinese laborers for their rice and sugar plantations.
Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after suffering defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been restored to give visitors a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the size most commonly used for still photographs worldwide is 35 mm. This was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue era.
It is still produced, but, above all, the image sensor formats of digital cameras have inherited its aspect ratio.
Somewhat confusingly, the 35-millimeter size is actually 36 millimeters wide and 24 millimeters high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this size (divided by twelve to get the simplest aspect ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family) either match or are very close to this aspect ratio.
Often misused and ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism in an image while maintaining a measure of order.
It states that the most effective location of the main subject is at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal thirds of the image (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had united the nations of Europe despite differences in language and culture.
Its pervasive power affected everyone, kings and commoners alike.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are earmarked for just such use.
The centralized power of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question the doctrine's validity.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital supplies to soldiers and civilians, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by numerous international treaties over the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to deny access to entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the tactic provoked only limited reactions, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations resolved to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods: Each phase of China, or each ruling dynasty, had its own dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was a period of unstable division of provinces, the most famous of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought fiercely for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying as they fought for the highest seat in Xi'an's mighty palace.
The social and political consequences were many, including the adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belonged to the people rather than to a single ruler.
And after the revolution, they also opened up positions to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true in the army, where military ranks were now based on ability rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things outside of daily life, and he often went to meditate in a cave that came to be known as Hira, located on Mount Nur, meaning "Mountain of Light".
The cave itself, left alone by the ravages of time, gives a very vivid impression of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Located in one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's very difficult to find, even if you know it's there.
All you can see is the clear, beautiful sky above you and the many mountains surrounding you, but inside the cave, you see or hear very little of the world below.
The Giza Necropolis, located on the Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx of Giza.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramidlike structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
Located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, the Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, includes several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The rising spring symbol looks like the letter V, and the falling spring symbol looks like a rivet or a square with no bottom line.
A rising bow means that you should start at the tip and push the bow; a falling bow means that you should start at the fret (where you hold the bow in your hand) and pull the bow.
A rising spring usually produces a softer sound, while a falling spring is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to add your own notes in pencil, but remember that the printed suspension marks are on the sheet music for musical reasons and should generally be followed.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of working women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the king's sister Elisabeth to return from Versailles to Paris.
They were returning to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to throw open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved the head of a bodyguard killed at Versailles before the shocked queen.
The Filipinos themselves had to pay the war costs incurred by U.S. imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government, which covered much of the cost, and to pay interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the primary benefit of U.S. imperialism was the huge profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand the Knights Templar, you have to understand the context in which the organization was born.
The period in which these events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history between 1000 and 1300 AD.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, generally considered to have ended about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term which in practice covers a very wide range of ideas from the so-called technological imperative to the absolute notion that human destiny is governed by a logic based on scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two basic ideas: first, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond the reach of cultural and political influence, and second, that technology in turn has natural rather than socially conditioned "effects" on societies.
For example, one could argue that the invention of the automobile would inevitably lead to the development of roads.
On the other hand, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership results in more road accidents, leading to the development of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism was a major ingredient in Romanticism and was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was seen as shaping individuals; over time, the customs and culture typical of that geographical location took shape, and because these were in harmony with society, they worked better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began about A.D. 400 and continued until about 1100.
Its position was weakened in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders had returned home with gifts such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of slow communications, Western European styles may have lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of the era was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothing with the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is farming that produces just enough food to support the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses seeds native to the ecoregion combined with shifting cultivation or other relatively simple practices to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel rejected by society's norms and are thus able to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct and separate may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender or sexuality-related, geographic, or a combination of several different factors.
Often, members of a subculture communicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to use the example of the few unfortunate children who grew up without adult socialization, either through neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse.
Some children have been isolated by humans (often their own parents), and in some cases abandonment has been caused by parents rejecting a child with a severe mental or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals, some said to have lived on their own in the wild.
If a feral child has been raised entirely by an animal other than man, he will behave (within his physical limitations) in almost exactly the same way as his animal guardians, for example, showing a similar fear or indifference toward humans.
Project-based learning aims to make learning easier and more interesting.Scaffolding goes a step further.
The stairs are not a learning method but a tool to support individuals in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Ladders can be both virtual and real, so a teacher is a kind of ladder, but so is a little paper-clip doll in Microsoft Office.
Virtual ladders are built into the software and are designed to ask questions, give prompts and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner to do on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and nurturing, but some do.
We like to think of the foster care system as a safe haven for these kids.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, consistent education and reliable health care.
The purpose of the placement of children is to provide them with all the basic amenities they lacked in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet imply additional dimensions in the case of use-case theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are suggested as important influences on Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' as new influencer perspectives when studying audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to determine whether a person is lying.
In his article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks described how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still judge sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic modification: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation; selection removes it from the pool of variation already present.
With each generation, differentiation and recombination transfer variation back and forth between these two reservoirs.
The primate, which has a digestive system similar to man's, finds it difficult to obtain enough amino acids from the plants available on the savannah.
Moreover, deprivation has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and finally death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins from leaves and legumes, but primates like us have a hard time digesting them without cooking.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily digested and are rich in proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
So we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the intentional waking up during a normal sleep period and falling back to sleep a short time later (10 to 60 minutes).
This is easily accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores consciousness but does not fully awaken you.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it across the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before going to bed, forcing yourself to get out of bed to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive his life force, the more possible it is for everyone to find complete peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only obstacle to that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but with the addition of the concept of the Mahayana, or great path, and many of the techniques of Indian yoga.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, involving kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga, where visualizing the deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and develops an awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which is why the Soviet Union and the United States worked together, but after the war, clashes of systems, procedures and cultures led to a rift between the two countries.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it was a real war, because proxy armies fought on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defences were already broken by 17 September 1939, and the only hope was to withdraw and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
Almost overnight, however, these plans were shattered when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army marched into the country and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts by invading eastern Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The role of navies has traditionally been to ensure that one country maintains its ability to move its own people and goods while disrupting the enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the United States tried to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, mostly with submarines, tried to block this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds that roamed over hilly terrain or other pastures, often tended by goatherds who were often children or young adults, like the better-known sheep herders.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the chariot roads consisted only of parallel wooden beams, they allowed horses to pull the chariots faster and with greater loads than on the more uneven roads of ancient times.
Railroad ties were introduced fairly early to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that rails would be more effective if they were topped with iron rails.
The practice became common, but the iron wore out more than the wooden wheels of the chariots.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, when Homo erectus evolved.
The Australopithecus that preceded it didn't walk upright as continuously.
Specialization in bipedalism is found in 4.2-3.9 million-year-old Australopithecus fossils, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
This is often like treating the symptoms of a disease, but if we do not want just a temporary solution, we should find the roots of the problems and eliminate them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have increased because of overpopulation and mankind's wasteful way of life.
After Congress approved it on July 4, a handwritten copy, signed by the president of the convention, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies, now known as the Dunlap broadsides, were printed.
John Nixon read the document aloud in public for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap plaques known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's a lot of stuff in birds that still looks like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the processing of information coded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The surest sign of internal poisoning is the visible presence of an open bottle of medicine or a container of a toxic household chemical.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions for the particular poison.
It is this group of insects that entomologists call bedbugs.
The term comes from the fact that in ancient times bedbugs were very common, and bedbugs are insects well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both predators and bedbugs are brood parasites, adapted to live in their host's nest or cocoon.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, or MS, in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
The couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
If they wish, these couples can make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can act as the child's parents.
The main task of science is to use scientific methods to find out how the world works, and the scientific method guides most scientific research.
However, it's not just about doing experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Scientists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined in the West, it lost touch with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in body structure and behavior are often very much dependent on the existence of innate cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not simply responses to external seasonal stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to cycle freely for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's work was one of the most important clues that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, labeling either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, how important a part of the genome is affected, and whether they affect germ cells or other cells.
Mutations that occur only in germ cells can be passed on to children, and mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural sites to enjoy the scenery - including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities at the destination include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, learning from, and photographing Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people in small rural towns drive to work and are met by others whose jobs are in the towns they left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to and supportive of the car-based transport system.
Science now suggests that a massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about transport systems.
Rarely in the developed world do you hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because it is not possible to predict drivers' behaviour with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers is relatively consistent, so traffic flows tend to have a fairly good consistency and can be represented in a rough mathematical way.
In order to better describe traffic flows, a relationship has been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships is helpful in planning, designing and maintaining roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back against their bodies.
This gives them a wider variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the entire solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, does it?
The Amazon is the world's second longest and largest river, containing more than eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's widest river, at 6 miles at its widest point.
A full 20 percent of the planet's water flowing into the oceans originates in the Amazon.
The Amazon River itself is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size or construction skill.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest sovereign state and the world's smallest state by population.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Most of the people who work for the government also speak Italian as their everyday language, but Latin is often used for religious services.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Common chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, have been known to man since ancient times because they all occur naturally and are also relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a combination of one or more elements, which he called earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter - solid, liquid, gas and plasma, in that order - but he also theorized that they change into other substances to form what we see.
Alloy metals are basically mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and then there are metals like gold and silver.
There are also alloys of metals with small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it first came on the market.
Unfortunately, with the development of new writing methods, the value and uses of the pencil have fallen into disuse.
Nowadays, messages are typed on a computer screen, and the sharpener never has to be removed.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus made up of many protons and neutrons.
Sort of like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that make them prone to break apart with little or no pushing.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The moon's crust is about 45 miles [70 km] thick on the near side and 60 miles [100 km] on the far side.
It's thinner under the oceans and thicker in the highlands.
There may be more dark areas of the ocean on the visible side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are primarily concerned with what motivates or appeals to people's behavior.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as adults.
These theories look at why some people want what they want and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
Generally speaking, when leaders begin to manage their former peers, two distinct behaviors may emerge: at one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, maintaining discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, a person is molded into an unrecognizable individual who feels he must change everything the group has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the group.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to perform at the same level of quality as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members act as liaisons to their immediate physical team.
They often have more decision-making power than regular team members because their teams may meet in different time zones and their local administration may not always understand this.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique elements of a virtual team.
An invisible team is a management team to which all members report, and an invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organisation, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
As a result, a process where an organisation works together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that serves customers' needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, managers need to create an innovative culture and share knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, therefore narrowing the field and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the scientists' findings.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The proliferation of new technologies allows us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
And this gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI tends to be strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research is aimed at making machines perform tasks that require intelligence automatically.
Examples include supervision, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become distinct disciplines focused on providing solutions to real problems.
Today, AI is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and national defense, just as it is built into many home computer and video game software applications.
Class trips are an important part of teaching and often the teacher would like to take the pupils to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution: virtual classroom tours, where students can look at museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting at a desk.
Sharing a class trip virtually is an excellent way to remember it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capitol.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. In the early stages of students' blogging experience, grammar and spelling are often sloppy, but the presence of an audience usually changes things.
Since the students themselves are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to make an effort to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to be more aware of the world around them". The need to feed the reader's interest inspires students to be witty and interesting (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can allow students to be more analytical and critical. By actively responding to material on the Internet, students can define their position against the background of other people's writing, as well as bring out their own perspective on the issue at hand" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive bilingual capital, with a rich array of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Farther south are Niagara Falls, and to the north is Muskoka, with its unspoiled natural beauty.
These and many other factors give Ontario the impression of being a place that outsiders view as the very model of Canada.
Large areas farther north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A surprising demographic comparison is this: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest of these, and by nature it is like its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or part of France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought with them Islam, which flourished in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
It is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women - All female travellers, regardless of actual marital status, are advised to state that they are married.
Wearing a ring also helps (as long as it does not look too valuable.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they may perceive as harassment.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences do not justify sexual advances!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the tenth century B.C.E. by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port, which they called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar-ul-Badya, and Spanish traders who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
In the old medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide variety of trinkets, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002 the volcanic eruption of Nyiragongo devastated Goma, burying most of its streets, especially in the center.
Goma is reasonably safe, but all trips outside the city require prior investigation to ascertain the current status of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and for finding the cheapest mountain gorilla trackers in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis), the usual (local) fare being about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relatively inconvenient location, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
It was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990 because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
In stark contrast with other cities in the country, it has more of an Arab feel than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different nature reserves, each supporting a different fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there is a daily conservation and entrance fee.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to either some or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory and is a major tourist attraction.
The succession of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a shimmering pattern of columns, best seen in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across to the Kowloon harbor area.
Most of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is located on the densely built-up landfill of the North Shore.
This is where the British colonial masters made their home, and it is a good place to start if you are looking for signs of the region's colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching 50 miles [80 km] from the coast to the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Indian part of the forest is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests, however, are not mere mangroves but include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the entire Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about a third of which is covered by wetlands or swamps.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 tigers and some 30,000 moose.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially to the east and to Jakari and Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Since buses within the region are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most prefectures are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Triple taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the towns of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two towers reach a height of 272 feet [83 m], it is 1,250 feet [378 m] long, and it has two lanes 11 feet [3.5 m] wide.
Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian border stations are estimated to be completed.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers.
Other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payagua, lived in the Chaco region and subsisted by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, once called the "Giant Province of the Indies", is the result of a 16th-century encounter between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen in other seasons.
The Argentine Polo Association provides information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged to the pound sterling (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, opposite FIC West.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Island currency outside the islands themselves, so exchange your money before leaving.
Because of its location south of the equator, Montevideo has summer when the northern hemisphere has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and temperatures over 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool, with temperatures rarely dropping below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no distinct wet and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend staying at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from other wildlife.
Bison, deer, bears, and almost any large animal may attack, even though they may appear to be very tame.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance, but these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, bear in mind that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing in or preparing strong-smelling foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships - German, American, and British - refused to leave.
All ships sunk except one British cruiser, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the Mau struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the assassination of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches because Auckland is located between two harbors, and the most popular are located in three different areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the borough of North Harbour) are on the Pacific coast and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are sometimes busy family beaches, and the shoreline is lined with a good selection of shops.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a multidimensional beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are several French wines worth trying, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better preserved on the trip.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find for the cautious.
The idea of a flat white-type latte is foreign to Australians. A small black coffee is known as an espresso, and a cappuccino is served with a large amount of whipped cream instead of foamed milk. Tea is served without milk.
The cocoa meets Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare on the reef.
So heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish are found north of 1770 near beaches and estuaries from October to April and occasionally at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and are likely to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the sea, but their primary habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
When a traveler books in advance, he has the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives.
Travel agents often have offers for certain hotels, but it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (e.g. a visa) for your destination.
However, all changes and requests should first be routed through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp in the area and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get music near the campsite.
Keep in mind that even after the main stage music has ended, there may be places at festivals where the music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in wintertime, check the cabin location, as going through the ice makes a terrible noise in the worst parts.
St. Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city.Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see specific conditions).
Casinos typically try their best to maximize the time and money spent by customers.
They often have special offers on food, drinks and entertainment to keep customers happy and in the casino.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or very cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction and you cannot drive as you would on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that the car gets stuck.
Visibility may also be reduced by snowfall or blowing snow and by moisture or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic usually operates year-round without interruption.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's greatest attraction and, for many, the highlight of a visit.
Nationally, the word safari refers to traveling overland to view Africa's magnificent wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and ordinary equipment is quite sufficient for viewing them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking,
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but based on the situation at the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend into July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with tickets usually costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels allow you to borrow an iron and an ironing board even if you do not have them in your room.
If an iron is not available or if you are not particularly fond of ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as this may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
Different methods of water purification exist, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have doubts, consider buying water from a reputable company in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to their area.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, spread toxins, and transmit disease.
Actual infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are generally not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping refers to the possibility to buy products at certain locations which are exempt from excise and sales taxes.
Travelers to heavily taxed lands may sometimes save considerable sums of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it repeatedly traverses remote forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware - there are many steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are much lower than on the earlier and later sections - generally 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 kilometers per hour) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Strangely, the cell phone coverage is much better here than in many other places along the way, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
German pastries are quite good, and Bavarian pastries are quite rich and varied, reminiscent of those of our southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common; apple cakes are made year-round, and cherries and plums are popular fillings in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes often taste especially good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices together with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either 'dry' or 'wet' depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the peninsula, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional food cultures across the country.
But when used without further qualification, it usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago and includes a large range of simply spiced dishes.
The stirrups are the rider's footrests that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but there may be safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off his horse and gets his foot caught in the stirrup, a runaway horse may try to pull him back, and various precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
For one thing, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth and rather narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety bar that allows the stirrup strap to release from the saddle if a falling rider pulls it backward.
Cochamón Valley - Chile's number one climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America.
From its peaks, the views are breathtaking, and climbers from all over the world are constantly carving new routes up its endless walls.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve descending a slope on skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important tourist activity, and many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski bums, plan entire vacations in a particular destination around skiing.
Skiing is a very old idea - cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of alpine skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski resort in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski mountaineering or ski touring.
It is related to alpine skiing-style hiking or mountaineering, but usually does not include them, since the latter is practiced on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and monopods.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions you can go somewhat faster than on foot, but very rarely will you reach the same speed as when skiing on groomed slopes and without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean filling in visa applications and passing through passport controls many times.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area operates somewhat like a single state.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you also do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a manufactured antique; some tax authorities define anything more than a hundred years old as an antique.
The definition varies according to geographical location; for example, in North America, newer objects are considered antiques than in Europe.
Handicraft products may be defined as antiques even if they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important occupation for the Sami people, and the culture associated with it is also important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi have engaged in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but live from fishing, hunting and similar occupations and keep reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people work in modern professions and tourism is an important source of income for the Sami people.
Although the word gypsy is widely used, especially by non-Roma, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.

The course usually covers all the topics discussed here in much greater detail and is usually combined with practical experience.
The course usually lasts from two to five days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on wilderness survival are common, but publications on war zones are few.
Travelers planning to have gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documentation for the return trip.
The willingness of authorities to issue passports without an indication of gender (X) or to update documents to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign authorities to respect these documents varies just as much.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery should not be expected to pass through security scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning currents of waves breaking on the shore, often found on reefs or similar places.
Because of underwater landforms, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper parts, where it can form a fast current into deep water.
Most deaths result from exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be swept away again, or depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, it may be wise to wait for rescuers.
Return shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the familiarization period is shorter), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travellers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to re-adapt to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to get used to a new country.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
For children, the sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the area's main attractions.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and before the show begins, they can be seen in complete silence.

The scenes are set against the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by many nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active bases as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island, where the Villa Las Estrellas settlement is located.
Others are Livingstone Island and Deception, where the water-filled crater of a still-active volcano serves as a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea on the south side of the peninsula.
There the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plain and then rise again to form the 220-mile-long [360 km] Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, the Sentinel Mountains, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with its highest peak, Mount Vinson, at 16,028 feet [4,892 m].
In remote areas where there is no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
Satellite phones are not usually a substitute for mobile phones, since to make a call you have to be outdoors and have an unobstructed view of the satellite.
The service is widely used in the maritime industry, including pleasure yachts, as well as by expeditions that need remote data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider will probably be able to give you further information on how to connect to this service.

Finland is an excellent destination for boating.The country of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
On islands and lakes, you may not need a boat the size of a sailboat.
Although the offshore islands and the largest lakes are large enough for any boat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a popular leisure activity in Finland, where there are boats for every seven or eight people.
The proportion is the same as in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise very rare (e.g. 1 in 40 in the Netherlands).
Most genuine Baltic cruises include an extended visit to St. Petersburg.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days and still return to the ship at night to sleep.
You do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore on a cruise (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, so a visit is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced something traumatic.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from many other people's own fears and aversions about some other things.
For some, some understanding of the workings of an airplane and what happens during a flight may help to overcome fear of the unknown or of feeling helpless.
Transport companies are well paid for fast deliveries, which are often crucial for business documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
The larger companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but on other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent goods by air freight, some routes could take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get the item through more quickly was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations prohibit sending baggage without a passenger, so you're needed at this point.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or perhaps prefer to have your company do it for you).
But it doesn't come cheap: a rough rule of thumb is that you can expect to pay up to four times as much for business class as for economy, and eleven times as much for first class!
On direct flights from point A to point B, it is generally not worth even looking for discounts on business or first class seats.
The airlines know that there is a certain core group of air travellers who are willing to pay a lot to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău.The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.

The conflict led to the declaration of independence in 1994 of the Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own administration and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Economic links have been re-established between the two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

The rough exterior of the Parisians quickly evaporates if you show ordinary courtesy.
Plitvice National Park is heavily forested with beech, spruce, and pine trees, and its vegetation is a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
There is a remarkable variety of plant communities because of the variety of microclimates, varied soils, and differences in elevation.
The region is also home to an extraordinary variety of animal and bird species.
In addition to more common species, you can find rare animals, such as bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and raccoons
Women visiting monasteries should wear skirts that cover the knees, and the shoulders should also be covered.
But if you bring your own scarf, especially a bright one, you may get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men need to wear pants that reach below the knee.
You can also borrow them from the entrance wardrobe, but they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil for everything.

Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses and are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations, located in remote regions where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Cherry blossom viewing, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
