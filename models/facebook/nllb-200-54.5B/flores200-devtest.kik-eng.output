This not only eliminates the possibility that dinosaurs had wings, a popular theory, but also adds information not found in the fossil record, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists describe all the feathers covering the insect's body as white above and red or purple below.
These patterns provide fascinating insight into how the wings of birds change over time.
Since dinosaur wings do not have a fully developed shaft, called a rachis, but instead have barbs and barbules, the researchers surmised that the rachis must have grown in a similar fashion as the shape of the wing changed over time.
The design of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature measurement or display. The researchers concluded that if this was the tail of a small dinosaur, the pattern would suggest that the feathers belonged to a living animal, not a small terrestrial animal.
Researchers concluded that if the skeleton was that of a small dinosaur, the design would suggest the wings belonged to a full-grown animal, not a small terrestrial one.

Marteli was sworn in wearing the new uniform of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) on election day.
It was Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a commission convened by the president's office recommended the early resignation of the CEP as part of the country's preparations for new elections.
The commission was formed by Martelly in response to the proliferation of anti-government demonstrations that began in October.
This sometimes perplexing institution was established by the absence of an election, which is to be held every two thousand and eleven years.
Nearly sixty cases of faulty iPods malfunctioning due to excessive speed have been reported, resulting in six fires that left four people seriously injured.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 fires linked to the reactors.
Last week, the METI claimed that Apple had provided them with information about thirty-four other high-speed crashes, which the company said were "not too bad".
The Ministry responded by saying that Apple's actions of not publishing and correcting the report was regrettable.

The photographers then substituted for the old woman who had promised to help. Mendoza was pronounced dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
And when he was employed in the hospital, Liggins began to examine the problem of premature birth in his spare time.
Her research showed that hormone replacement therapy could speed up the development of embryos.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the plane's flight data recorder on Wednesday.
And the wrestlers that wrestled with him gave the last honour unto Luna.

Of the 1,400 voters who cast ballots in the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent in 2012.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the death of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled favored Queen Elizabeth II as the next monarch.
Notably, in the same poll, 29 percent of those polled said they believed Australia should retain its monarchy as much as possible, while 31 percent believed it should not become a republic.

It is predicted that he will stand for the presidency in the year two thousand and sixteen.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and help save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of traditional ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to track aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no other public transport in addition to the cable cars that stop at Wembley, and car parking and mobility aids are not provided on the ground.
The fear of failure is compounded by the likelihood that the project will be completed without major delays.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science found the creation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorean Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species have appeared in just two generations, although the accepted order likely took much longer than that because of crossbreeding between the common Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold may be formed into many shapes; but brass into a few.
These could then be twisted and glued together to form flat sheets of wire.
It was so highly polished that it was sometimes used to illustrate illuminated manuscripts called illuminated books
This is called the pH of chemistry, and you can create a sample using a bucket of vegetables.
Vegetable dyes change color depending on whether they are acidic or alkaline.
The pH scale measures the amount of Hydrogen (H in pH) ions present in a chemical solution.
Hydrogen ions are protons that are replaced by electrons (Hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Go round about the threshing-floor together, and with clean hands play upon the cymbals.

The pyramids of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro featured earthen mounds for nearly every building, linked by an elaborate system of cisterns.
Remains of this technique have been found in Minoan monuments on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Bathrooms existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China; in Roman civilization, they were sometimes the only part of a public bathhouse where men and women bathed together.
When you make a long-distance phone call, you are sending a message to a satellite.
Satellites in space pick up signals and send them back to earth instantly.
Scientists send telescopes into space because the earth's atmosphere blocks out some of the sun's light.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space requires a huge rocket well over a hundred feet [100 m] long.
The wheel has changed the world dramatically. One of the greatest advances of the wheel is that it has made transportation easier and faster.
He gave us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on small animals, from rabbits to deer and antelope.
Finally, there are the many small cats (including domestic cats) that feed on a variety of small animals, including insects, small reptiles, frogs, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in their contentment and concentration, a unique trait shared by all cats.
Lions are the largest of the big cats, and they live in huge groups called prides.
A pride is made up of from one to three living lions, with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The female is kept in close confinement in a large enclosure.
A pride of lions is like a pack of wolves or hyenas, and the extraordinary lions (but not the other big cats) have habits that make them especially dangerous to their prey.
the finest of all beasts of burden, the mouse can bite (but not chew), jump, run long distances, and strike with five times the force of a strong man.
The mouse (Genius Panthera) belongs to the same family as lions, tigers, and leopards.
The voice of the wild ass is not as the roaring of a lion, but as a roaring lion.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. They prey on mice, snakes, reptiles, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals the ocelot targets are smaller and longer than this.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by using their sense of smell.
Ocelots can see well in the dark and have night vision, and they can navigate. Ocelots hunt for prey by blending into their surroundings, attacking and capturing prey.
When a small group of organisms (a population) becomes separated from its original population (for example, by moving to a new mountain or river, or moving to a new island and then rapidly returning), it often and frequently finds itself in a different environment than it was before.
The new islands have many different species and many different climates, so the new arrivals need different climates or environments in order to be more competitive than their predecessors.
For many, the adjustment may not be as drastic as they initially expected.
After a while, as the new arrivals adjust to their new surroundings, they gradually begin to resemble the original inhabitants.
At length, after thousands or millions of years, the multitude became so numerous and varied that no one species could be distinguished.
We call this process speciation, which basically means the production of a new species. These new species arise without being influenced by the major branches of evolution.
Plants take in oxygen when humans breathe it in and release carbon dioxide when humans breathe it out.
Plants use photosynthesis to make food from sunlight and to generate heat.
We build our houses with plants and make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the largest animal known at the time, and its only real threat was mosasaurs.
And his strong teeth were joined together by threescore and ten rows, and his teeth were set in his mouth, that he might not put out his hand.
It is not known for certain, but it had a forked tongue. It ate aquatic animals, such as fish, and was thought to be carnivorous.
And it devoured every living thing that moved in the waters, save only the behemoth, which was exceeding stupid.
Although many of their dishes are familiar, the Romans specialized in such exotic dishes as wild boar, gourds, and quail, as well as the common dormouse.
Another difference was, that while the poor men and women sat on couches to eat their meals, the rich were accustomed to have common tables, where they sat on their couches to eat their meals.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not have included foods imported from Europe or the Americas centuries later.
For example, they had no sugarcane, tomatoes, corn, or cocoa, and no wealthy Roman needed a gun.
The Babylonians built huge obelisks that served as dwellings for each of their gods.
The people would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to appease them by performing rituals.
Each temple had a small, open courtyard containing the temple sanctuary, where only the priests were allowed to enter
ziggurats, towers that sometimes flanked temples
The top of the tower served as a shrine to a god
In the hot climate of the Middle East, these dwellings were a welcome sight
most of the hebrew household life took place in the open air
The women plow in the field, and the walls are open in the streets. The stones are used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, forests were scarce and timber was expensive
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled farther west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
In any case, Eskimo tribes inhabited the area at the time.
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were Scandinavian nations with distinct peoples, rulers, cultures, and histories.
If thou hast seen my National Treasure, thou mayest well imagine the precious stones placed there after the declaration of independence.
However, this is not true. Even if something did occur after conception, it is not significant.
The text after the Declaration of Independence is the words "original Declaration of Independence dated the fourth day of August in the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four". This text appears at the bottom of the page, underlined.
Although the artist is unknown, it is known that in its original state, a large sheet of paper (293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it is possible that this text was added later as an appendix.
The D-day landings and subsequent raids came from northern France but from the south.
These are Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in nineteen forty and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On the fifteenth of August, nineteen hundred and forty, the allies invaded southern France, in what was called "Operation Dragon".
In less than two weeks, American and French troops quietly withdrew from southern France toward Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, combined with the Latin civis, meaning citizen and civitas, meaning city or city-state, both of which refer to the sovereignty of the state.
City-states precede states. A civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, a long-lasting culture, and the achievement of justice.
A few generations pass away without leaving any valuable history or evidence and are not recognized as a great civilization.
During the turbulence of the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen colonies formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole branch - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power of taxation, and because it had no executive or judicial branches, it relied on state governments, which often did not cooperate with it, to enforce laws.
In addition, I had no authority to enforce customs laws between the islands and the states.
The Constitution had to be ratified by all the states before it could be implemented and the states took over the central government with such ease that its representatives rarely visited the seats.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful national football team in the world, after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, boxing, handball, water polo, fencing, rugby, motorcycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are popular in the north, and Italians compete in national championships and the Olympics.
Consisting of some 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), Japan is the seventh-largest archipelago in the world.
Due to its large number of offshore islands, Japan is known geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's origins can be traced back to the 15th century when European sailors passing nearby named it Ilha Formosa, or Wild Island.
Around 1624, the Dutch East India Company in southwestern Taiwan began to develop home-growing techniques for the poor and hired Chinese laborers to work in the salt and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) conquered the western and northern parts of Taiwan and established Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shomonoseki, which ceded Taiwan independence to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the old houses have been restored to give visitors an idea of what they once looked like.
By 1976, about 30 percent had been restored, and restoration efforts are still under way.
For example, most still photographs are 35mm wide.
They are still studied today, but the aspect ratio has been improved by digital cameras.
The camera is 35mm wide by 36mm high and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this figure (divided by twelve to get a whole number) is 3:2.
Other formats (APS, various file formats, for example) will match or approach this aspect ratio.
The widely used and criticized rule of thirds is a simple and important example of proportional representation.
It says: "The ideal location for photography is at the intersection of three intersecting straight lines (see illustration).
In the meantime, the wealth and power of the Catholic Church were being questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Europe's many linguistic and cultural differences were bridged by the Christian religion.
For by reason of his great power he deceiveth all men, from the king even unto the people.
one of the fundamental doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to relieve poverty and that church funds are evil for this reason.
For more than a thousand years, the church remained in the hands of the Roman hierarchy, and its constant campaign for power and money left many wondering whether it was doing what was needed.
Following the outbreak of hostilities, Britain blockaded Germany with U-boats.
This strategy proved ineffective and prevented valuable resources from reaching families and ordinary people, but its implementation was in violation of international law, which had been adopted and enforced around the world two centuries earlier.
Britain restricted territorial waters to prevent any vessel from entering the island's coast, which made non-military shipping dangerous.
Because there was little public opposition to the plan, the Germans claimed that their submarine warfare program would not be attacked.
IN THE 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the order of the day.
After witnessing the horrors of World War I, the nations resolved to prevent similar atrocities in the future.
In 1884, Tesla traveled to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with only four dollars, a notebook, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his attorney when he retired) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own unique system of time-keeping; each Chinese era was ruled by a different dynasty.
Between the two dynasties there was a period of unrest between the provinces due to disunity. The famous Three Kingdoms epoch lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
At that time there was a great struggle between the nobles for supremacy.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, when tens of thousands of people died trying to reach the Great Wall outside Xi'an.
There were many social and political developments, such as the adoption of the metric system, from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single leader.
The change of the government from a male-dominated to a female-dominated system led to an exodus of visionaries.
This was also the case with the pillars, for instead of dividing the pillars according to length, they were divided according to caliber.
The French Revolution gave impetus to revolutions of oppressed foreign workers.
Muhammad was interested in the things beyond this life. He had the opportunity to go to the cave which he later called "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to see.
The cave itself, which has remained since antiquity, testifies to the virtue of Muhammad's faith.
Located on a hill overlooking Mecca, it is isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is hardly to be seen if one knows of its existence. When one is in it, it is completely absent.
There was nothing to be seen but the empty heavens, and many mountains round about; and very little of the earth could be seen from the bottom of the pit.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians, is just one of many pyramids erected in honor of the Pharaoh after his death.
The Giza Necropolis beneath Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several tombs, several mosques, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and other smaller pyramids, tombs, and mosques were built in honor of Khufu's wives and concubines.
An "up bow" is a V-shaped bow, and a "down bow" is a staple bow.
Up says YES you have to tell the frog and push the bow and down says YES you have to tell the frog (here is your hand holding the bow) and push the bow.
An up-bow often produces a lower pitched sound than a down-bow.
If you want, you can mark your answers, but keep in mind that the marks on the four arrows correspond to the ten sounds, so expect to receive a YES.
King Louis XVI's widow, Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789, were returned to Paris from Versailles in the guise of prostitutes.
They went to Paris by train, surrounded by a crowd of people who were chanting slogans against the king and queen.
THE crowd opened the windows of the king and queen's chariot.
On another occasion, a crowd pointed out to the queen the head of their guard, who had been executed at Versailles.
The outcome of the Philippine Revolution was the U.S. being defeated by the Filipinos.
They were fined by the Philippine government to pay damages and interest on bonds issued by the Philippine government to Wall Street Banking houses.
In fact, a large portion of the money paid by Filipinos went to the U.S. colonial government.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the times in which they conceived this law.
The High Middle Ages is the period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages after 1500.
The foundation of quantum mechanics is formed by a number of assumptions about the behavior of matter, ranging from the assumption to the conclusion that quantum mechanics is related to the logic and laws of physics underlying quantum mechanics.
The analysis of contemporary artistic developments makes two assumptions: that contemporary artistic developments are socially and politically relevant, and that contemporary art is primarily concerned with social rather than cultural issues.
To illustrate, imagine that a road is to be built.
National roads are not economically viable if they support few vehicles, so policies to maintain and reduce their cost must be developed.
Traffic jams wreak havoc on the roads, and ambulances are needed to treat injured bodies in hospitals.
Romanticism had a strong influence on cultural determinism, with writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to Romanticism, geography was the source of culture, and hence of life and knowledge derived from geography, which, because it was associated with cities, was superior to the laws of nature.
Just as Paris was the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of Europe.
It is believed to have been cultivated as a source of sweet corn from 400 A.D. to 1100 A.D.
Its power was greatly enhanced in the twelfth century by the Crusaders who brought gifts of spices and food that were more expensive than those sold in Byzantine markets.
It was during this time that the name Fashion Capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was popular between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
IN THE beginning, textile production was influenced by Byzantine influence in the East.
However, due to the slow pace of modernization, the railway in the east was delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Europeans began to develop their own styles of embroidery.
Subsistence farming is the practice of producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is simple agriculture, often using natural resources and using seeds adapted to the climate or using simple methods to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who share common goals and are able to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, race, class, location, and/or gender.
The four elements of cultural diversity are language, culture, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination thereof.
Members of a group often express their identity through stereotypes, such as clothing, customs, and language.
One of the best-known ways to highlight the importance of communication is to examine some of the negative effects of childhood neglect, conscious abuse, and lack of communication by adults
Such children are referred to as "feral" or wild. Some feral children are abandoned by humans (usually their parents); others are abandoned because the parents reject the child because of a mental or physical disability.
Feral cubs are more likely to be injured or killed before they are abandoned or eaten.
Some have been lured by the promise of a bribe; others have been lured by the promise of easy money.
Raised primarily by non-human animals, feral children display behaviors that closely resemble those of the animal that raised them, such as fear or reluctance toward humans.
When the foundation has been laid and the project is to be simplified and made more efficient, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not an original method but a support that helps people learn something new such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both physical and virtual, for example, a teacher uses a scaffold similar to the paper clip man found in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and their function is to assist the learner in dealing with isolation.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to adolescence.
No child deserves to be brought up in an environment that lacks good training and education, but it does exist.
We felt that adoption was the best way to protect our children.
The education and training of these children ought to be such as to give them a secure home, a loving teacher, an adequate education, and perfect health.
The householder shall furnish the necessaries of life in the house where he is educated.
The Internet has revolutionized both public and private communication.
Social networking has given rise to a spirit of competition and rivalry.
For example, "reading" and "communicating" are some of the activities facilitated by the use of the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Introversion" and ""love potion"" were also used by Eighmey and McCord (1998) to survey the opinions of readers and viewers of websites.
The use of thin-film optics has led to important advances in the understanding of microwave transmissions, transmissions of electromagnetic waves that last a few microseconds.
It is said that one can tell if a person is lying by his facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay, The President's Speech, argued that people who are unable to speak due to mental illness have a good sense of proportion.
She noted that similar abilities can be found in other animals, such as dogs.
During the 20th century, research revealed that there are two basic types of genes - recessive and dominant.
Mutations increase the abundance of new, unrelated genes in a population.
Separation and mixing cause conflict between the two pools in every generation.
And in the savanna, it is difficult for primates to obtain the amino acids they need from local plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available are vegetable proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for animals to digest unless instructed.
In contrast, animal foods (fats, vegetables, eggs) can be digested quickly and provide high-protein amino acids.
After all, we wouldn't have to worry if our ancestors had the" cure for protein deficiency" in the same way that savannas' chimpanzees do.
REM sleep is the transition from wakefulness to normal sleep and is characterized by brief (between 10 and 60 minutes) periods of sleep onset.
This can easily be done by using an alarm clock that is not very loud so as to awaken you from a deep sleep.
If you find that you have to change your sheets while you are asleep, you can move them to another room so that you can get out of bed earlier.
Other biorhythms include heavy drinking (especially water or tea, or prescribed medication) before bedtime, which stimulates wakefulness
The measure of a man's inward happiness is the change and sorrow of his inward body and spirit.
The less fear there is, the better is the vitality of the life. Every one is capable of peace and contentment.
Wisdom cometh to all men: but fear of the wicked, and prejudice, hindereth it.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but translated into the Mahayana style in many ways from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has Kundalini Yoga, a universal meditation on love.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (wisdom energy) is awakened by yoga exercises, breathing exercises, mantras and visions.
Central to Tibetan thought is Diety yoga. Through various practices and dieties the energy of the scriptures is purified, chakras are activated and consciousness is formed.
Germany was an international enemy during World War II, which led to the Soviet Union and the United States forming an alliance. After the war, the two countries clashed over differences in political, economic, and military systems.
Within two years of the end of the war, friendships had turned into enemies and a cold war had begun.
It would last for another four decades and would be fought by proxy armies in the theaters from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish forces had been defeated, and all hope of a new offensive was gone.
However, these plans came to nothing by nightfall, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian armies then invading eastern Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression pact, and numerous bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods was the cheapest way of transporting bulk cargo and people across oceans.
The purpose of navies has always been to ensure that your country's ability to transport people and goods, and to defeat the ability of its enemies to transport people and goods.
A well-known and recent example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, in which the United States tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic in support of Britain.
Meanwhile, German submarines closed in on our fleet.
If the Germans had been defeated, Germany might have won, as she had won all Europe.
Goats are thought to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the foothills of the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient traditions and myths began to use it as a means of divination to see the sea, the cows, the meat, and the sun.
Herds of domestic goats grazed on hillsides or in pastures and were often tended by children or by experienced shepherds, similar to the methods used by famous shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th Century.
But if the Wagonways were made of timber, they enabled the horses to run faster and to draw heavier loads than the unbroken roads of the time.
Crossties were first used to hold bullets where they were not needed. However, it was found that bullets would be better if they had pieces of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron wheels of wooden wagons wore out more quickly.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first iron rails were put in place.
The earliest known means of locomotion was on foot, with human migration beginning two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (standing man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright.
The special ability to use two legs to stand or walk appeared in Australopithecus fossils from four million years ago until two to three million years ago, while Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can cultivate close friendships with our neighbors, associate with our local congregation, and act as stewards to lessen the impact of future problems.
But if we would not have a momentary remedy, we must seek out the root of the matter, and remove it.
It is a world transformed by rapid scientific and technological advances, rapid population growth, and high living standards.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, the original handwritten copy was checked by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson and shipped a few miles to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Overnight, between one hundred and fifty and two hundred more copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first of many such readings was by John Nixon outside Independence Hall on July 8.
One copy was sent to George Washington in mid-July, and it was read to the troops in New York on July 9.
Twenty-five Dunlap broadsides are known to exist and are the oldest surviving copies of the manuscript; the original manuscript copy has not survived.
Most modern paleontologists believe that dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Most people think of dinosaurs as wingless, flightless creatures.
Yet, birds have much in common with dinosaurs.
It has huge, webbed feet, lays eggs, and walks on two legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all modern computers are based on the binary numeral system.
Binary numbers have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits for short.
Toxicity may not be readily apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are common and therefore immediate diagnosis is not possible.
A good example of indoor air pollution is the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
check the label for first aid instructions for the poison.
Dodoologists consider them to be a species or subspecies of monkeys.
The name comes from the resemblance of the eggs to tadpoles, which inhabit the bodies of humans and other animals.
Robots, for example, are amazing creatures, and they are designed to live in or near their host's light source.
Across the Americas, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading cause of brain, nerve, and spinal cord damage in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.

The ultimate goal of science is to discover how the universe works by applying the scientific method.
Nevertheless, experimentation, and simulation are experiments used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and observe that also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers heavily influenced Latin texts, especially the Latin Vulgate.
Aristotle's views permeated every field of science, including philosophy.
As Greek philosophy declined, the West became increasingly isolated from its roots in Greek philosophy and science.
Many find it easier to adhere to and return to psychology and rituals that rely more on the presence of recurring cycles from within and their structure than to those that change a person according to the clock.
Precise timekeeping, which goes beyond mere response to external signals, is built into the very fabric of life, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks, or biological timepieces, are finely tuned oscillators that operate independently of external cues.
The Hershey-Chae experiment was one of the first attempts to link DNA to genes.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
In two experiments, phage DNA was stained with radioactive phosphorus or phage proteins were stained with radioactive sulfur.
Genetic mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the severity of the genetic defect and whether the affected cells have germ-line mutations.
However, certain mutations that are passed on to other germ-lines can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who have a strong desire to visit natural areas in order to enjoy nature, including its flora and fauna.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird-watching, exploring national parks, and reading about nature are just some of the activities available on the islands.
We visited, photographed, and studied orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, commuters travel by bus from the countryside to their place of work and pass by a makeshift shelter.
In this ever-changing shuttle of perfection, everyone is connected to, and supportive of, a transportation system based on personal vehicles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy destroyed the biosphere of one of the world's most stable islands, which in turn supported the development and evolution of humans over the next two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and follows the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developing lands, it is not uncommon to hear of such protests as wells burst or roads collapse.
Why doth this system provoke such strife, why doth it daily work iniquity? or are not the engineers of transportation perfect? or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to assess the quality of traffic on these roads because the driver's behavior cannot be reliably predicted.
During the summer, drivers tend to drive in pairs; therefore, the lanes alongside busy roads are usually numbered and may be marked by yellow signs.
To illustrate safe driving on a highway, compare three attitudes: (1) alertness, (2) vigilance, and (3) speed.
This relationship can help in the planning, design and implementation of road infrastructure.
Sparrows were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly enabled them to hunt and forage more easily and to reproduce more efficiently.
Many winged insects have the advantage of being able to move their wings back and forth along their body.
This gives us a few places to hide from predators.
Today, only dragonflies and mayflies do not flap their wings.
Thousands of years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristarchus proposed that the earth revolved around the sun.
Some thought he knew, but it is generally accepted that the solar system revolved around the earth and not around the sun (or other stars).
which seems reasonable because the earth does not seem to rotate, does it?

Italian is the everyday language of most of the state's employees, while Latin is used for religious ceremonies.
Vatican City, the capital, is almost entirely Roman Catholic.
Humans have known about the chemical elements gold, silver, and copper since prehistoric times, because they can be found in nature in uncombined form and are relatively easy to identify in the fossil record.
Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
The four fundamental states of matter (solid, liquid, gas, and plasma) are thought to undergo chemical reactions to give rise to all living things.
A basic alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Note that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are classified as metals. Of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
All matter in the universe is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit into the tiny space described at the end of this sentence.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, were not primarily hunter-gatherers.
Unfortunately, as new forms of writing have appeared, the benzo has been reduced to the point where it is useless.
People now e-mail one another without ever having to touch a computer.
One can only wonder what will happen to the heap when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to fuse a nucleus with protons and neutrons.
It is like undoing a tire on a bicycle. Breaking the nucleus again releases some of the energy.
Some atoms have nuclei that expand - that is, decay - with little or no pressure.
The Moon's upper mantle is composed of rock and ice. The Moon's outer shell is called the Moon's crust.

And Mary stood nearest: for the rod was loosed, and she went up to heaven.
Attraction theory is based on the idea that people are attracted to things that will make them feel good.
These theories suggested that humans have four basic needs and/or desires that are developed over the course of development into adulthood.
These theories explore why four people like or dislike certain things and how their environment influences their choices.
Two well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's dualism.
Generally speaking, two attitudes may emerge when representatives begin to dominate their former associates. One end of the cycle is to try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take corrective action, set standards of performance, establish credibility, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, he finds himself becoming increasingly isolated and feels compelled to change everything about the congregation.
After all, it is the superior who ultimately determines the success or failure of the group.
This attitude often creates a barrier between the clergy and the laity.
Social networks are subject to the same rigorous standards as traditional networks, but there are subtle differences.
Those in the mobile group often serve as a bridge to their visible group.
Often they have more freedom than the traditional group because their congregations can meet in different time zones that local delegates may not understand.
The presence of a genuine "invisible community" (Larson and LaFasto, nineteenth century, early nineteenth century) is also a characteristic feature of mobile communities.
The "invisible flock" is the representative body to which each member of the congregation belongs.
Why would a congregation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a study group?
When all the tools are put to good use in the various branches of the worldwide congregation, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As it turned out, a team approach to solving a problem could lead to a new marketing strategy that would better serve the needs of the customer.
Before the flock can be industrious, the leadership must cultivate the habit of industriousness, and also the wisdom of cooperation and learning in the flock.
Angel (2000) describes the Continual Improvement approach as the method used to help congregations reach a high level of effectiveness.
The field of Neurobiology provides empirical evidence of the non-linearity of cognitive functioning. It therefore examines where functioning is inhibited and where it is enhanced.
The relationship between epidemiology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been recognized that various forms of brain damage, including seizures, concussions, and seizure-related disorders, influence behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The advent of new working hours allows us to see and examine buildings and structures that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and building blocks for simulations that help us understand patterns in our mental world.
Although AI has a strong scientific reputation for abstract reasoning, AI forms an important branch of computer science, focusing on behavior, learning and artificial intelligence.
Research in the field of AI focuses on the design of machines that can autonomously perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include visualization, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to user inputs and commands, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become popular doctrines, which attempt to solve the problems inherent in this life.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of finance, medicine, engineering and mathematics, as built into the world of home computers and video game operating systems.
Field trips are an important part of any course. Often the instructor will want to take his students to places where bus transportation is not available.
The use of ropes offers a solution to the problem of travel. Students can explore museums, visit the aquarium, or admire beautiful paintings while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing travel experiences is also a good way to revive travel memories and share knowledge and predictions for the future.
For example, each year students from Bennet School in North Carolina make a list of their trips to the State Capital, and each year the list is updated, but the old list is kept on file as an album.
A list of words and phrases can also help a student's writing. While students often begin their practice of a list of words and phrases with a grasp of grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience often changes this.
And since the students are generally the most important listeners, the secretary of the synagogue tries his best to prevent mistakes from being made.
And since students are often the most important listeners, the author of the list of topics and discussions initiates a disciplinary effort to prevent mistakes from being made. Also, introducing topics and discussions to the list "does not encourage students to become more aware of the world around them" (Toto, 2004).
Giving lectures and discussions on the lists encourages participation, and encourages students to read beyond the normal school day.
Effective use of verbal and nonverbal cues "can enable students to become more observant and to ask questions; by responding to items on a list, students can express themselves in terms of the writings of others as well as express their views on four topics (Oravec, 2002).
