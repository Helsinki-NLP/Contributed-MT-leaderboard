This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details not typically obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that this animal had a crown color on top and a grayish or carotenoid color underneath.
The discovery gives us an insight into the evolution of gills in birds.
Because the dinosaur's claws (called rachis) are not well-developed, but have other claws - barbs and barbels - the researchers realized that rachis was probably a later evolutionary stage than those other claws.
The structure of the claws suggests that they were used during flight only for temperature control or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen shows the claw of the adult bird and not the chicken's claw.
The researchers suggested that, although this is a tail from a juvenile dinosaur, the clubbed specimen represents the adult bird and not the juvenile's fine claw.
Two police officers were killed and more than twenty others injured when a car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning.
The governor's office said nineteen of those injured were police officers.
Police said they believed an alleged militant affiliated with Daesh (ISIL) was responsible for the attack.
They found that the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system was found to be driven by its luminosity, its rotation, and nothing else.
The combination of luminosity and rotation is used to determine a star's Rossby number, a number related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less magnetically active the star is.

Tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter created the effect the team was looking for.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth, which creates tides, the Milky Way exerts a gravitational pull on the galaxy of Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter, just as ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a ring-like manner, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: the voters themselves share the booth, a pre-printed sheet of paper with their preferred candidate indicated in a letter envelope.
After the identity of the voter has been verified by the officials, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
French electoral law codifies the procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there is no envelope at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes have been added except those relating to duly identified and duly authorised voters.
In the afternoon, votes are consulted by a team of volunteers under strict supervision, and according to specific procedures.

He was initially at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her own son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from eyewitnesses may be tainted because her pictures have been widely published.
This is standard practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and courts have considered that publication of a photograph could be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said that "journalists seem to be missing the right balance if they publish pictures etc. of suspects".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has told journalists that there will be no further comment until at least an indictment has been made.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, borders sought by Palestine based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
The future of the state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the question of the Jordan Valley are said to have been among the other topics covered.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years when an agreement is signed but the PA only agrees to be present for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control trial were to be closely supervised by a supervisor, as the trial was monitored and its effects evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Heritage with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, says that the four shooters selected for the first round of shooting were given comprehensive safety and training training.
Martely swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in the last four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards a new election.
The Commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime, which began in October.
Failure to hold elections, some of which had been due since 2011, led to the sometimes violent protests.
There have been approximately 60 reported cases of a malfunctioning iPod becoming overheated, in total resulting in six fires, leaving four with minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating events, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry's response was to say that Apple's postponement of the report was a "cause for deep regret".
At nineteen minutes after seven (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday) in the morning the Mariana earthquake struck.
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said no damage was reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also indicated that there was no tsunami signal.
A former Philippine policeman kidnapped a busload of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippine Islands.
Rolanda Mendoza fired her M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed missing so far.
He soon released hostages, including the children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Later the photographers took the place of an old woman because she wanted to use the toilet.
Liggins did as his father had done before him and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began to investigate, in his spare time, premature births.
His research showed that fetal lung maturation occurs faster with hormone administration.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow climbers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. The first manager I had. Luna disappeared on the night of the two moons. That was so unusual for her. A strong woman".
According to Dustin "Goldust" Runnels' comment "Luna was as wise as I was...more so perhaps...I love her and will miss her dearly...I hope she is in a better place now".
Of 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
The same view is held by 34 percent of the public, who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last reigning monarch.
At extreme points of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
He was the winner of the Olympic gold medal for swimming in the 100m and 200m freestyle event and three Commonwealth Games relay races, but his complaints cast doubt on his fitness.
He was unable to take the drugs, needed to ease his pain, because they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
The discovery had been verified by several people by early February, using various hardware and software, and was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were sources of Earth's water supply along with organic matter capable of making protein and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of a planet, especially the formation of the Earth, from a comet impact.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said the rumours were "political claptrap and saber-rattling".
There is speculation that he will stand in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than the older ground-based radar technology to allow an air traffic controller to locate aircraft more accurately and to provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is being provided and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parking or parking and travel facilities at the stadium.
There were concerns about a lack of transportation and the likelihood that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors and without team fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species emerged within two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer, due to crossbreeding between the native Darwin's green, Geospiza forteas, and the immigrant cactus green, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be liberated into many kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn until it is a thin wire, which can be dipped and plated.
It can be made very thin, and glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "colored script".
An indicator can be made from red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice varies depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since a hydrogen atom is composed of only a proton and an electron).
Mix two dry powders together vigorously and use clean, wet hands to fuse them into a ball.
The moisture on your hand will react with the outermost layers, which will feel strange and make a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan houses in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathing houses, as men and women gathered together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down, instantly, of course.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope up in space.
The world has changed incredibly since the invention of the wheel.
It is the birthplace of the train, the automobile, and countless other transportation systems.
They produce larger medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including outdoor pet cats) that eat the even more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The easiest way to explain their success is the concept of the niche, each individual cat has a special job so that it does not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions consists of one to three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Females tend to be closely related, as it is a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lionesses behave like a pack of jackals or deer, animals similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their quite bizarre behaviour and always deadly to their prey as well.
The tiger is a comprehensive athlete, able to climb (but not well), swim, jump great distances and pull with a force five times stronger than a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard and the jaguar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, it is more like a sentence of broken, broken words.
Horseshoe crabs like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that prey on the horseshoe crabs are smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots use their olfactory ability to locate animals for food (prey), by smelling their trail on the ground.
They have night vision which gives them very good vision in the dark, and they move toward prey with it.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (if they move across a mountain or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they often find themselves in an environment unlike the one they were in before.
There are different resources and different competitors in this new environment, so the new community will need different features or adaptations to compete strongly.
The original population is the same as it ever was, and needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, similarities between them and the other population tend to decrease.
Eventually, after thousands, or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that they cannot be designated as the same species.
We call this process speciation, which literally means the creation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, no animals could survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator during its time and therefore feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 sharp teeth as well as a carriage of other teeth, rendering it inescapable to anything that crossed it.
We don't know for sure, but she may have had a forked tongue. Her diet included turtles, large fish, other mussels, and possibly even cannibalism.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex would not have been able to.
While we would be familiar with most of their food, the Romans had their own share of exotic or unusual feast items, including wild turkey, the peacock, snails, and a type of rodent known as the sleeper mouse.
Another difference was that the poor men and women ate their meals sitting in an armchair, while the rich men preferred the custom of feasting together lying on their laps while eating their meals.
Ancient Romans could not have eaten foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in subsequent centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa and an ancient Roman never tasted turkeys.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods and considered that the god resided there.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
No one was allowed to enter the inner courtyard of the temple, but only the priests.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of the temples.
A separate sanctuary for the god was at the top of the tower.
In the hot climate of the Mediterranean, the house was not so important.
Much of the Hebridean child's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street.
The land of Canaan had few forests, which made timber very expensive.
Few people settled in Greenland. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while travelling further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of what he discovered, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each was a 'Nordic country', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776".
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, we do know that the large paper document (which is 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage early in his life.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added as one label.
The D-Day Landings and the battles that followed succeeded in liberating northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was under the control of the "Vichy" French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture in which a large and significant group of people live and work together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil; it is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and determines the size of its society in some way.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. The culture of a civilization is understood to involve the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint and reasonable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any material historical evidence behind and are therefore not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially created a weak central government - with Congress as the only existing part - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as it had no national executive or judiciary, relied on state authorities to enforce all its acts, but these authorities often refused to cooperate.
It also had no authority to violate tax laws or tariffs between states.
The unanimous consent of all the states had to be obtained before the Articles could be amended and these states were so dependent on the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national football team, the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
The most popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, pilates, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
There are about 7,000 islands in Japan (Honshu being the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its island group, Japan is often referred to, in geographical terms, as an "archipelago".
The first mention of Taiwan was in the 15th century when European sailors sailing past the island of Formosa were baptized.
The Dutch East India Company established a headquarters in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, initiating a change in production practices for the native grain and hiring workers from China to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after their defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which they cede sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better taste of what it looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration has continued to the present day.
For example, 35mm is the world's most common still image photography format, being the most widely used in cinematography at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today but more importantly its aspect ratio has continued on into digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high, which can be confusing.
The aspect ratio of this format is said to be 3:2 (divide by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (e.g. APS formats) are equal to or very close to this slope ratio.
The rule of attributes is a simple guideline, although sometimes ignored or ridiculed, that creates dynamism and gives some order to an image.
It states that where the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally intersect, was the most effective place for the main content (see example).
During that period in European history, the Catholic Church came under intense scrutiny after acquiring great wealth and power.
For more than a thousand years, European states, despite their different languages and customs, have been bound together by the faith of Christianity.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from kings to slaves.
It is one of the main principles of Christianity that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church monetary funds exist specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church was located in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this red principle was being fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of war, Britain imposed naval blockades on Germany.
It was an effective strategy, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although these sanctions violated generally accepted international law codified in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response in its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to spare future generations from such suffering.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States he had only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China a specific way of representing different time periods was used; each stage of China or each ruling child was a distinct dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty there would be a period of unrest in which the provinces would split.
During these periods there was violent warfare between many of the nobility fighting for possession of the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms period, when thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution all male applicants were given the opportunity of a career, allowing those with the highest ambition and the greatest success to succeed in life.
In the case of the military it is similar in the sense that army rankings are now based on rank rather than social class.
The French Revolution inspired many of the oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad took a keen interest in spiritual matters. He used to meditate in a cave called "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (light).
The cave itself, which still survives, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to know if anyone knew he was there.
Nothing can be seen except the beautiful clear sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
One of the seven wonders still standing today is the Great Pyramid at Giza.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Kings contains several pyramids (the largest being the great pyramid), along with several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'bow-up' mark is very similar to a V and the 'bow-down' mark is similar to a staple or a square with its lower side missing.
Up means you should start at the chest and push the bow, and down means you should start at the chest (that's where your hand grips the bow) and pull the bow.
Upstrokes generally have a softer sound, while downstrokes have a stronger, more dominant sound.
There is no problem with drawing up your own marks, but remember that the printed soft marks are there for a musical reason, so they should be taken into account.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, her two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, all terrorized by a mob of women, returned to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
At one point a member of the crowd decapitated a royal guard, killed at Versailles, right in front of the terrified Queen.
It was the people of the Philippine Islands themselves who paid for the war costs incurred by U.S. imperialism in its attempt to subjugate the Philippines.
They had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay for much of the expense and interest on bonds established in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the people of the Philippine Islands would be a major gain for U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context from which the order grew.
The High Middle Ages is the common name for the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300) when the events in question took place.
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in fact, from the push of technology or the necessity of technology to a rigorous understanding that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic involving scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most readings of technological determinism share two general theories: that the development of technology itself follows a path that transcends cultural or political influence and that technology consequently has "impacts" on societies that are innate rather than socially learned.
For example, it can be said that because the car exists, the development of roads is necessary.
However, national road networks are not viable for a few cars, so new productivity methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car ownership leads to more road accidents and to the development of new methods of treating injured bodies in healthcare.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time geography gave rise to customs and culture, which, in harmony with the place of society, were superior to unjustly applied laws.
As Paris became the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was renowned as the centre of society from 400 A.D. until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than what was available in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style was in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
In the early days clothing style was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the east may be delayed by 25 or 30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages the people of western Europe developed their own style, and this was one of the major developments of the time.
Subsistence farming is farming which produces only enough food for the farmer and his/her family.
Maintenance agriculture is often a simple, organic system, using saved seeds indigenous to that ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise production.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming and this is the case in most developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel out of place in mainstream society; it is an opportunity for them to understand their own identity.
Subcultures can be specific because of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
A particular subculture may be defined by linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic qualities, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through the symbolic use of a particular style including fashion, goth and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized with adult help while growing up, for reasons of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse.
Such children are said to be "feral". There are certain feral children who have been kept captive (sometimes by their own parents); in some cases the child suffered severe mental or physical abuse that led the parents to abandon the child.
Feral children may have been involved in child abuse or serious trauma before they were abandoned or ran away from home.
They are allegedly animals raised by other people; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a non-human animal adopts a human from the beginning, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost identical to the behavior of the particular care animal, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
The scaffolding is not a learning method but a facility that supports people undertaking a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold but so is the little paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are internalised in the software and are designed to question, stimulate and explain procedures, which may be challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in residential care for many different reasons ranging from neglect, abuse and even exploitation.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, compassionate and educational, but it is.
We feel that the Nursing Home System is a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system was designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Nursery care is intended to provide for all the needs that were missing in the home from which the children were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
Additional dimensions follow from the characteristics of the Internet in terms of the approach of uses and satisfactions.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are said to be the motivations for most people to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational aspects when they investigated community responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microwaves, facial expressions lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is required that a person can detect if the person is telling lies by interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, suggested that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess seriousness.
He even suggests that animals such as domestic dogs may have this ability to make sense of human behaviour.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic diversity: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic diversity, and is removed by selection during expression changes.
Separation and recombination move diversity back and forth between two pools in each generation.
Outside the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its requirements for amino acids from the available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so has disastrous consequences: stunting, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources were the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide high-quality proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Overall, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is when you deliberately wake up during your normal sleep period before falling back asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythm involve drinking plenty of liquids (especially water or tea which are known to stimulate urination) before going to bed, so that you have to get up to urinate.
There is a negative correlation between a person's inner peace and the amount of tension in that person's body and spirit.
If the tension is low, it is the affirmation of the life force that is present.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. Nothing prevents this goal except tensions and negative attitudes that we may have in ourselves.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they were expanded with the mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yogas.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The God Yoga is the heart of Tibetan meditation. By visualizing various deities, the energy pathways are cleared, the chakras are activated and insight into wisdom is gained.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which encouraged cooperation between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. With the end of the war, however, differences in political system, process, and culture led to disagreement between the countries.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for 40 years and the fighting would actually be done, at close quarters, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and several other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were defeated almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The function of a navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country can always move your people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move those people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans sought to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to aid the British.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to bring Britain under its control as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have first been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and hides.
Goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing places, often led by goatherds who were usually children or young people, similar to the shepherd as he is widely known.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they enabled the horse-drawn carriages to achieve better speed and to pull larger loads on the slightly shorter routes.
The cross-links were introduced relatively early to secure the rails in place, but it was gradually realised that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron strip on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron was the reason for spending more on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking is the earliest form of human locomotion. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "standing man").
Its predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk head-on as often.
Haplotype specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is just like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if a temporary solution is not enough, then we should find the root cause of the problems, and solve them.
It is clear that the world has changed considerably as a result of mankind's scientific and technological developments, and that overpopulation and mankind's socialist lifestyle have increased difficulties.
After it was accepted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now called "Dunlap broadsides".
This document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap folios known to still exist are the oldest extant copies of the document; the original manuscript copy has not survived.
Some paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs lived and are still alive.
Many people think they are not dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are still very similar to dinosaurs.
They have scales and hooves on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, as they are called in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent.Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that an immediate diagnosis is not possible.
The best sign of poisoning may be the presence of an open container of a household pharmaceutical or toxic chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term insect in a formal sense is used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term "bed whale" comes from man's ancestry of these insects; they are insects adapted to parasitize humans.
Bed bugs and mealworms are scavenging insects, adapted to live in a nest or in the dwelling of their hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) across the United States, making it the most common neurological disease suffered by young and middle-aged adults.
MS disease affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that females are twice as likely as males to have MS.
A couple may decide that it would not be in their best interests, nor in the best interests of their child, to have a child.
These couples have the option of drawing up an adoption plan for their child.
By adopting a child, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that actually guides most scientific research.
But it's not by itself, experimentation, and experimentation is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, scientific research is asking questions and recording an opinion.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Accept Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychological ones.
As knowledge of Greece declined, Western countries became detached from their roots in Greek philosophy and science.
The presence of genetic material and its production by the body clock is often strongly influenced by the strength of known rhythms in physiology and behavior.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to periodic external cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue for a period of time to cycle freely even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA contained genetic material.
With bacteriophages, or viruses, Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments marking the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in one germline cell can be passed on to offspring, but mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts interested people to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including wild plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in their cars to go to their workplaces and pass other people whose work destination is in the place just left by the others.
In this dynamic transport context, everyone is involved in and supportive of a transport system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you don't usually hear as many complaints about water quality or reports of collapsing bridges.
Why do we get so many complaints about transport systems, why do they fail on a daily basis?
Traffic Flow focuses on the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with certainty.
Fortunately, driver behaviour is usually within a relatively stable range; traffic flows are therefore relatively stable and can be represented mathematically to a greater or lesser extent.
To better reflect traffic flows, a relationship has been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
This relationship is helpful when planning, designing and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to venture outdoors. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back parallel to their bodies
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, all insects, except the great bustard and the mayfly, can fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
There were people who thought he was right but many others believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river on Earth. It carries over 8 times as much water and is the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, six miles wide in places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows out of the planet's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed for their size, and their excellent technical construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at that time.
With a population of around 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country and the least densely populated.
The Italian used by Vatican City in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language used by most people working in the state but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to humans since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in native form and are relatively simple to extract from ores with basic tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was composed of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more akin to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they coalesce into new substances to make what we see.
An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
It can contain alloys, including small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that the period at the end of this sentence would hold trillions of them.
So the pencil, when it first came on the market, was a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, the pencil is not used as much now that new writing methods have become available.
People now write messages on computer screens, without the need to use an editor.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes onto the market.
The first fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is needed to fuse a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, some of that energy is released when the nucleus splits again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which cause them to tend to break apart with little or no friction.
The Moon's surface is composed of rocks and dust.
The crust is 70 cm thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker below the highlands.
There may be more maria on the adjacent side because the crust is thinner there.
Subject theories focus on finding out what people need, or what they enjoy.
These theories argue that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they grow into adults.
These are theories that focus on why certain people want to do certain things and what things in their environment would cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory are two common subject matter theories.
In general, two types of behaviour can emerge as managers begin to give leadership to their former peers.
This type of manager has difficulty making decisions, initiating disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you could turn into an anonymous person who feels he or she has to fundamentally change everything the team has been practicing, and completely put your own spin on it.
Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to conflict between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual staff often act as the contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more independence than normal staff members as their teams may meet in different time zones not understood by their local management.
The existence of an "invisible virtual team" is also a unique feature of a virtual team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. It is the invisible team that sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to spend the time needed to set up a learning organisation?One goal of applying organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across an organisation's functional departments, creativity and efficiency can flourish.
As a result, the organisation's process of working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovation process that meets the customer need.
Before new ideas can be introduced, leaders need to create a culture of innovation along with knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
In Angel (2006), the Continuum approach is explained as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. This makes the research field narrower and much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been recognised that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors disrupt behaviour and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
It provides a wealth of information and materials for constructing visualization models that help us understand processes in the human mind.
Although AI has a strong science fiction flavor, AI is a very important branch of computer science, discussing intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose and answer customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such subjects are now distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-world problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it is now embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom, and teachers often want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website on the subject of their trip to the State Capitol, each year the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve a student's writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the writer of the blog begins by trying to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "causes students to become more aware of the world around them".[24] It is the need to satisfy the audience's curiosity that motivates students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration, and encourages students to contribute their learning outside of the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to improve their analytical and critical skills; by actively responding to Internet content, students can express their own position in the context of other people's writings as well as formulate their own views on certain topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's elegant, bilingual capital and home to art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka and its tributaries.
With all this and more, Ontario presents itself to outsiders as typical Canada.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and partly uninhabited wilderness.
Here's a demographic comparison that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a territory in itself in terms of wildlife.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations, or dependencies of France, and known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the lands, and it was eagerly adopted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route, the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Pacific Ocean and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female travellers are advised to state whether they are married or not.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (don't wear one that looks too expensive.
Women should understand that what would be considered harassment may be the result of cultural differences and that it is common for someone to follow you, kiss your cheek, etc.
Be firm in your refusal to listen to men, and do not hesitate to stand up for yourself (even if cultural differences are involved, this is neither right nor fair!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and Spanish traders, who established trading posts there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old part of Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookah, and a wide range of mixed drinks, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was rocked by a lava flow from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the city streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is relatively safe, research should be undertaken before visiting outside Goma to assess the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and has some of the cheapest opportunities to track the Mountain Gorilla in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.
Because it is also relatively inaccessible, the word "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for countries, indigenous, far away.
Today Timbuktu is a poor town, although it is a famous tourist attraction, and has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
There is no similarity between this city and other cities in the country, as it has an Arab flavor rather than an African flavor.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Kruger River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecoregions, each supporting different wildlife.
It is a major tourist attraction and is regarded as a landmark of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African National Parks, daily fees are charged for conservation and park entry.
It used to be possible to buy a Free Card, which gives access to a selection of South African parks or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from Hong Kong Island and is the focus of many tourists.
People say that the parade of buildings on the Hong Kong skyline resembles an explosive barrage seen with reflection from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of urban developments on Hong Kong Island are built atop reclaimed land along the east coast.
This is where the British colonists took up residence and so if you want evidence of the days when the territory was a colony, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans, the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extends 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands from the coast.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, these are not just mangrove corks - they include some of the last remaining clumps of the huge forests that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is aquatic/fishing areas.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and the area is now home to an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 mountain lions.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable and accessible Japanese Coast Guard buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guinea.
The two towers extend 83 meters into the sky, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is today Eastern Paraguay; they lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and practiced subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, whose survival depended on hunting, gathering and fishing, also lived in the Chaco region.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, known as the "Big Five of the Indians", was founded as a result of the conflict between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial era, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and small games can also be watched here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and information on buying tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which has a fixed value equal to the value of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be transferred in the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West shop.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also usually accepted.
There is a risk that credit cards will not be accepted on the outlying islands, although British and US currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance what method of payment will be accepted.
It is almost impossible to use the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; the temperature does not usually stay below +30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be colder than you think; temperatures rarely fall below freezing but feel colder than you'd think from a thermometer when wind and humidity combine.
There is no "rainy season" or "dry season": there is the same amount of rainfall from one end of the year to the other.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is nevertheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, bears and foxes are kept at least 100 yards away, and all other types of wildlife 25 yards!
No matter how calm they look, bison, wolves, mice, bears and almost all large animals can attack people.
Each year, many visitors are injured because they do not keep their distance.These are large, wild animals and can be dangerous, so they must be given their proper space.
In addition, remember that some boils attract bears and other wildlife, so do not carry or cook strong smelling food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
It was in this harbour that the infamous mutiny took place in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
Almost 200 American and German casualties were sustained.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a crowd peacefully gathered in the town but the great chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed as a result.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is crossed by two harbours.
The beaches of the North Shore (North Bay area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most are sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, mostly shaded by pohutukawa trees.
First Tamaki's beaches are on Waitemata Bay, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops close to the beach.
'Number One' is the favourite beer of the locals, it's not complicated but it's pretty cold.
There are many French wines to buy, but these may be more travelled than Australian and New Zealand wines.
The local spring water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
If you're from Australia, the term 'flat white' is a foreign concept. A small black coffee is called an 'espresso', a cappuccino is topped with a lot of cream (not lamb), and no milk is added to the tea.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. The fruit juices are expensive but of better quality.
Several trips to the skies are taken from one end of the year to the other and injuries from any of these causes are rare on the skies.
Nevertheless, take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay careful attention to safety warnings.
The curly-tailed shearwater is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April on the north side of 1770.
Although there are sharks, they are fearful of humans and rarely attack.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their main habitat being river valleys north of Rockhampton.
Booking a place in advance gives the traveller peace of mind that he/she will have a place to sleep nearby when reaching the destination.
Travel agents can often negotiate with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, with a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages covering breakfast, transport arrangements to/from an airport or even flight and hotel packages together.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any minor changes or requests should first be made through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the decision to camp on-site is made by the majority of music festival attendees, and most attendees consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you like to be close to the action you will need to get in early to find a campsite close to the music.
Remember, although the music may have finished on the main stages, in parts of the festival music may be played until late at night.
Certain festivals offer special campsites for families with small children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as going through ice causes terrible noise for those most affected.
Some time is spent in the city during Saint Petersburg cruises. Passengers on cruises do not need a visa (see terms).
Usually, every effort is made in a casino to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment, to keep guests happy and in the restaurant.
Free alcoholic drinks are offered in some establishments.However, alcohol impairs judgment, and all gamblers know the importance of keeping your wits about you.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the risk of snow, ice, or temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snow-covered roads, there is little friction and it is not possible to drive as if on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, so much snow can fall in a short time that you are stranded.
Snow falling or blowing, condensation or ice on vehicle windows may limit visibility.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in most countries and cause little disruption to traffic throughout the year.
The safari is possibly the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
Travel abroad to see Africa's magnificent wildlife, especially on safari.
Certain animals, such as elephants and giraffes, have a habit of coming close to cars so that they can be seen well with standard equipment.
Lions, peacocks and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with glasses.
A walking safari (also called a "hermit walk", "walking safari", or "footing") is a walk, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March onwards most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not grant an extension until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Most tickets to the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, and a regular ticket ¥7,000.
Many hotels have an ironing and pressing program, even if one is not present in the room.
If an iron is not available, or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the cloth get too wet (which can cause shrinkage, or in worse cases, burns).
There are various ways of purifying water, some of which are effective against specific threats.
In some places it is enough to boil water for a minute, while in some other places a few minutes are needed.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Tourists may have to deal with pest animals unknown to them in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force, are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods in certain places without paying taxes or excise duties.
Travellers to countries with a high tax rate can save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway are found in the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which traverses often remote terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: they are mostly steep grades, narrow lanes and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are much lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is more important than ever that we fully comply with them.
Strangely, however, mobile phone service is stronger here than along many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite tasty, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those made in its southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are commonly available, containing baked apples throughout the year, and cherries and plums during the summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts are part of some German baked goods.
If you like some small but rich cakes, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, names depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
Cures may be 'dry' or 'wet' depending on the volume of liquid.
In inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used with curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional cooking styles found throughout the country.
However, if no further qualifiers are used, the term generally means that the food is native to the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, in the form of a range of simply flavoured dishes.
Stereoscopes are supports for the marksman's feet, and they hang on either side of the scope.
They provide better stability for the rider but can be a concern for people as they can trap the rider's feet.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and his foot gets caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse runs away.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and thin and rather narrow soles.
Subsequently, some saddles, notably English saddles, have safety bars, through which styrofoam leather can fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - the best place in Chile for climbers, called the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large walls and granite boulders.
The summits offer breathtaking mountain views.Climbers from all over the world are constantly finding new routes among the walls' limitless possibilities.
Snow sports with a slope, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you slide down snow-covered ground with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity and has many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", who plan entire holidays around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing is a fantasy - skiers appear in cave paintings dating as far back as 5000 BC!
As a sport, downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first skiing recreation club opened at Yorke in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, cross-country skiing or ski touring.
It is related to but usually not the same as cross-country alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter done on hanging terrain and requiring much straighter skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as something like a hiking trail.
If the weather is good, you'll be able to go further than you would on foot - but you'll rarely get cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack in suit tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but contains many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through many countries would require a person to apply for a visa and go through passport control repeatedly.
The Schengen area, to this extent, functions as if it were a single country.
Provided you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for any of the Schengen member countries, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes manufactured goods as antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods that are more than 100 years old.
There are geographical variations in the definition, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade items could be identified as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer farming is an important occupation among the Sámi and the culture related to trade is also important for people with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived by fishing, hunting and the like, and used reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region.
The word "Gypsy" is widely used but, especially among non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered an insult due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to get advice from a government other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For one example, American citizens may have to cope with different circumstances in the Middle East, than a European or Arab would.
An advisory report is simply a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The opinions presented are often general, oversimplified and terse compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Weather is a generic term for any type of hazardous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, disrupt life, or endanger human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
The effects of severe weather include high winds, sleet, rainfall resistance, and mountain burning, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include snow squalls, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any weather hazards in their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for 'Course in the polar environment' may turn up the address of a local organisation.
The course usually covers all the topics discussed here but in much greater detail, and usually provides practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2-5 days and will involve role play, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with life in the wild are widely available, but few publications deal with war zones.
Tourists planning sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they are carrying valid documentation for the journey home.
Not all governments are equally willing to issue a gender-neutral passport (X) or a document updated to include a chosen name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents varies equally.
Searches at security checkpoints have become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to be able to go through the scanners without any intrusion on their privacy or dignity.
Rip currents are currents that return from waves breaking off the beach, often at a jetty or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the twisting flow is concentrated in some deeper parts, which can create a fast current to deep water.
Most deaths are due to fatigue from attempting to swim back against the tide which may be possible.
It is not more difficult than usual to swim back, but to escape from the current first.
Try targeting a place you weren't born, or depending on your skill level and whether you've been spotted, it may be better to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock begins earlier than culture shock (it involves a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who have become accustomed to a new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt easily to returning to their native culture.
When you return after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and will have lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, and they knew that travellers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding will also be necessary for travellers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most popular attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them silently before the show starts.
The sound of tourists and vendors can usually be heard here.
The Sphinx is the background and narrator in the long story.
The scenes are often shown on the pyramids and the various pyramids are uploaded.
The South Shetland Islands, first discovered in 1819, are claimed by more than one nation.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the Peninsula. King George Island, on which the Villa Las Estrellas settlement is located, is the largest island.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception Island, as the underwater caldera from a still active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a southern region of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula are hidden in the high plateau here, before reappearing in the form of the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km chain bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, the highest of which is Mount Vernon at 4892 m.
In remote areas, without mobile phone coverage, satellite phone may be your only option.
In general, a satellite phone does not directly replace a mobile phone, because you have to be outdoors and in clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
Groups that frequently use this service include shipping, including pleasure boats, as well as tours with remote and remote sensing requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on how to connect to this service.
The option to travel and learn is becoming increasingly popular among those planning a gap year.
Many school leavers choose to do this, giving them a gap year before going to university, without interrupting their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course during a gap year abroad could improve your chances of moving into higher education when you return to your home country.
A tuition fee is usually charged for enrolment in these education programmes.
Finland is a great place for boating.This is the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" which also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You do not need a yacht in the islands and lakes.
Although the coastal islets and larger lakes are indeed relatively large for a single yacht, a smaller boat, or even a canoe, will offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is in line with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is unique in all other respects (e.g. the figure in the Netherlands is between one and forty).
A long visit to St. Petersburg in Russia is part of most Baltic Cruises.
This means that you can spend a few full days in the historic city and return to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only land using boat trips you would not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Berlin, Germany, is featured in the brochures of some cruises.As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near any sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if it is their first flight or if they have experienced previous trauma.
You should not be ashamed of it: it has nothing to do with the personal fear and loathing that many people have for other things.
For some people, understanding how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help them overcome fears based on the unknown, or not being in control of something.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly.Time is often money and getting business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs on time is crucial.
The largest companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but there was a problem for other routes and smaller firms.
If they sent things by plane, on certain routes they might have had to wait days to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through more quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, better still, ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general guide, you could expect to pay up to four times as much for business grade as for milk grade, and eleven times for first grade!
In general, it is not worth wasting your time looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the advantage of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they are charged accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, as a result of this conflict, the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria was created in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member.
Economic links between these two areas of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed and busy commercial centre, set around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches are interspersed among wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers, though the city's atmosphere is more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvik overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, on some tombs there are interesting marble sculptures of columns.
It was worth spending half an hour walking around the fascinating village.
To the north and quite close to it is the interesting romantic town of Sintra which attracted the attention of foreigners after Lord Byron proposed his illusion to the sky.
Scotturb Bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
And also from the north visit the Great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (shrine), world famous for Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are, in essence, visiting a mass grave site, a site of profound significance to a significant proportion of the world's population.
Many men and women who survived their time here are still alive, and many others who were murdered or killed by the work of their relatives, both Jews and non-Jews.
You are requested to treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not damage the site by graffiti or writing on the structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. About half of the population speaks Catalan, the majority understands it, and there are few non-Spanish speakers.
However, most signs are displayed only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is widely used in the public transport system and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are only in Catalan, but in the event of unplanned disruption an automated system announces in a wide range of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, impulsive and desperate.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to reconcile with Parisians is still to behave well, like a "bien élevé" (well-behaved person).
Parisians will lose their dull appearance if you are polite to them.
The Plitvice Lakes national park has forest cover, mainly beech, spruce and yew trees, and a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant species, due to its wide range of microclimates, different soils and different altitude levels.
The area is also home to a great diversity of animal and bird species.
It is home to rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wild boar, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and wear a veil over their cheeks, too.
Most monasteries provide umbrellas for women who come unprepared but if you bring your own, especially brightly coloured ones, you will get a big cheer from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are asked to wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but these clothes are not washed every time they are worn and so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Mallorcan food is based on bread, vegetables and meat (specifically pork) and olive oil is used over time, as in similar areas in the Mediterranean region.
Pa amb Oli is a simple dinner that is very popular, especially during the summer: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available seasonings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Every noun that is combined with the word Sie means 'you', it starts with a capital letter even in the middle of the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It may also be said that this makes reading easier, although writing is quite complicated due to the need to determine whether a verb or an adjective is used in the substance form.
Italian is relatively easy to pronounce because each word is pronounced exactly as it is written.
The letters c and g need to be watched out for more than any other letters because their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
Also make sure you pronounce r and rr differently: caro means expensive, but carro means car.
Persian grammar is relatively easy and mostly regular.
So, it would help you to learn a lot about Dari grammar and get a better understanding of phrases just by reading this basic grammar book.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people with some knowledge of Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough not to need to be studied on its own.
Few pre-modern observatories are still in use today, most being museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution was not a problem in their heyday, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, and tend to be more accessible than those built in these lifetimes.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the flowers of the plum tree are the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the nobility around the Imperial Court.
Plants look good in their natural environment, so don't give in to the temptation to remove even "one specimen".
If you are visiting a formally organised garden, you will be expelled without discussion, if you are collecting "specimens".
Singapore is generally very safe and easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything while you are there.
However, as it is located in the "high tropics", a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and strong sun (if the sky is clear, not so often).
Some buses go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you intend to take will be going into Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways could be a good theme when setting up a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or cruising to interesting cities on the Danube or taking a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They set out routes used for popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday are followed by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of not sleeping on Easter night and spending the night at some exposed point waiting to see the sunrise.
Christians of course have a divine explanation for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The Easter Vigil at a more traditional church is often held on Saturday Night during the Easter weekend, with the crowd often beginning celebrations at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
All the animals that first reached the islands did so by swimming, flying or swimming.
Because the mammals could not go there because the distance from the mainland was too far for them, the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of man on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the sky.
This is a very good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will necessarily be dark day and night.
Since these regions are sparsely populated and light pollution is not often a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners would be used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and workers use family names or job titles when calling each other.
There is nothing more important than workplace harmony, which emphasises group effort rather than individual achievement.
Workers often have to get their superior's approval for any decision they make, and are expected to follow their superior's orders without question.
