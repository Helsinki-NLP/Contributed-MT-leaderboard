This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but provides details not usually provided by fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this beast's feathers were chestnut brown at the top with a pale carrot color at the bottom.
The discovery also provides clues to the evolution of feathers in bones.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed shaft, called a tail, but had other feather features such as barbs and barbules, scientists thought that the tail was probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display.Scholars have suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not juvenile fur.
Researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not juvenile fur.

The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls on the Earth causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters go into a booth, put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting record.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes other than those of properly counted and authorized voters are added.
Candidates can send representatives to oversee any part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision following specific procedures.

Adekoya has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with beheading her son.
She is in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but any testimonial evidence may be tainted because her image has been made so public.
This is a common occurrence in the United Kingdom, but justice in Scotland operates differently and the courts have found that publishing photographs can be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says "journalists seem to be able to walk a fine line by publishing photos etc. of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which has overall responsibility for the proceedings, has told reporters that it will not comment further until the trial.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Other topics apparently discussed include the future of Jerusalem which is sacred to both countries and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the country for ten years once an agreement is signed while the PA agrees that this presence lasts only five years.
Those who participated in the supplemental disinfestation trial had to be closely monitored by the rangers, while the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In association with the NPWS the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Shooting Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new nine-person Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that erupted in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the lack of elections, some of which had been due to be held as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning overheated iPods were reported, causing two fires with four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week METI said that Apple had been notified of 34 additional overheating incidents that the company defined as "not serious".""
The ministry responded by saying that the delay in Apple's report was "really unfortunate".""
El terremoto el ga colpìo Mariana ae 07:19 ora locae (21:19 GMT venere).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reported no damage in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no tsunami warning.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including Boca and his neighbors, were also released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was beheaded.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a nurse and graduated from Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While teaching at the hospital, Liggins continued to study preterm birth in her spare time.
His research showed that if given a hormone it would stop the lungs of the rat from maturing.
Xinhua ga dito che i investigatori del governo mercoledì i ga recuperà do "scatole nere"" dei registratori de volo.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Unique as she was. Strong woman".
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels commented that ""Luna was as crazy as I was...maybe crazier...I love her and miss her...hope she's in a better place".""
Of the 1,400 people interviewed prior to the 2010 federal election, those who did not want Australia to be a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree with this idea and want Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the poll's conclusion, 29 percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100- and 200-metre freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints her health was put into question.
She was unable to take medication to overcome her grief as it is forbidden by the Zioghi.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest known prime number on January 25.
Many people tested the discovery using various tools and software from early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets struck the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, left office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said of the vows that they were "political checks and balances".
He has said he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly with shorter wheels and burn millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology that allows air traffic controllers to target aircraft more precisely and give pilots more accurate information.
No overnight transport has been operated and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and car park and interchange car parks are not available on the ground.
Fears over limited transportation raised the possibility that the game would be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study recently published in the journal Science deals with the emergence of a new species of bear on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden said that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process is expected to take much longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic species of Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn as a thin thread that can be twisted and broken. It can be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin and applied to other metals, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate handmade pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH. You can make a tracer with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by how many hydrogen ions (the pH Ha) are in the substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (since the hydrogen atom is made of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders together and sprinkle with wet, clean hands to make a paste.
The moist soil on the hand will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange sensation and form a kind of hood.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have a toilet in almost every house connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewers have been found in Minoan town houses on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bath buildings where men and women bathed together.
When someone calls you from far away you can use a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the call and sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts light and our view.
It takes a rocket more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel did for us was give us a more comfortable and faster means of transportation.
It brought rail, automobile, and many other modes of transportation.
These include medium-sized felids that eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including house cats) that eat many more small animals such as insects, mice, lizards, and bears.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special place each cat has that keeps it out of competition with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three closely related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related to one another, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions are a subset of wolf or dog packs, animals incredibly similar to lions (but not other felids) in behavior, and equally deadly to their prey.
An accomplished athlete, the tiger can crawl (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger goddess is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more like a phrase of wild gibberish.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals. It catches seeds, lizards, mice and bears if it can. Most of the animals the ocelot catches are smaller than itself.
Scientists think the ocelot follows and finds prey animals by scent, sensing where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move silently.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it came (such as if it moves across a mountain or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it is no longer good to return to easily) it will often find itself in a different environment than where it was before.
This new environment has many resources and many competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original population is largely unchanged, requiring the same adaptations as before.
Over time as the new population adapts to the new environment, they begin to look very different from any other population.
Eventually, after thousands and even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which basically means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe, and they capture carbon dioxide that humans exhale (breathe out).
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of what we eat is plants, and without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurs were the strongest predators of their time, fearing nothing but other mosasaurs.
It had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth in its mouth, and another on its palate, making it inescapable to those who caught it.
We are not sure but it may have had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, fish, other mosasaurs and may have been a cannibal.
Be careful of anything that gets in the water; even a T. rex would have a bad time.
Although many of their foods may have seemed ordinary, the Romans did have a taste for strange or unusual items such as wild boar, peacock feathers, limes, and a kind of drink called gyro.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat at tables, the rich feasted together and reclined on couches while they ate.
The food of the ancient Romans could not compare to food that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, coconuts, and no ancient Romans ate tachin.
The Babylonians for all their deities built a primary temple that was the home of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had a green courtyard and an inner sanctum where only the priest could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary of the god.
In the mild climate of the Middle East the house was not so important.
Much of a Jewish family's life was spent outside.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were on street benches; houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his westward journey he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even though he made his discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure you might think there's a treasure map written right on the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although there's some writing on the document itself, it's not a treasure map.
To the right of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". These words appear at the bottom of the document, on the reverse.
Although no one knows who wrote it, it is known that initially this large document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that this note was added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by Vichy France. These were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were fighting for the invaders instead of against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, in relation to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas meaning city or city-state, and in some ways defines the size of a society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. A culture of civilization means that passing on knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint is a fair spread.
Smaller cultures often disappeared without leaving significant historical traces and failed to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak, Congress-only central government under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, relied on often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its laws.
It also had no authority to nullify tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent of all the states before they could be modified and the states took over the central government with such alacrity that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with the Croatian national football team, the second most successful team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, rowing, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of its island groups, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors called the island Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the East India Company established a base on the southeastern part of Taiwan by attempting to change aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, giving control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures called Intihuatanam, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can get a better idea of what they must have looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been rebuilt, and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the world's most common still image photography format is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still made today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
El formato 35mm el xe in realtà, in modo un fià confuso, 36mm de larghesa e 24mm de altesa.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example the APS format group) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often-criticized rule of thirds is a simple guideline that provides dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the best location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal planes (see example).
In this period of European history the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years the Christian religion held the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Its power reaches everyone, from kings to peasants.
One of the main doctrines of the Christians is that charity should be used to alleviate tribulation and misery and that the churches are there for this purpose.
The center of church control remained in Rome for more than a thousand years, and all this power and authority made many question whether doctrine was being respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, the British established a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was successful, cutting off essential civilian and military supplies, although this blockade was a violation of generally accepted international law codified by many international agreements over the previous two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to block entire stretches of ocean to all shipping, causing damage even to neutral shipping.
As there was little to counter this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude of most cities and towns was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid another such in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States to work with the Edison company in New York City.
She arrived in the United States penniless, with a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (her former law partner) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of displaying the different periods of the year: today China's phases or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there were also periods of unrest in the divided provinces, the most famous of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were fierce wars between the various nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting for the top spot in the Great Hall of the People in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
Even after the Restoration, admissions and employment were open to all candidates but allowed the most ambitious to succeed.
The same was true for the military because instead of classifying the army by class, it was based on size.
The French Revolution inspired many other repressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave that became famous as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, offers a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Located on a mountaintop to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it is not easy to see at all even if one knew it existed. Once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen but the beautiful clear sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the most impressive), several small pyramids, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and female family members.
The "up arrow"" sign looks like a V and the ""down arrow"" sign looks like a paper clip or a square without the bottom edge.
Up means that you should point from the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should point from the frog (which is where it holds your bow) and pull the bow.
An upper string usually produces a softer sound, while a lower string usually produces a stronger, more decided sound.
Feel free to write your own marks in pencil, but remember that printed bow marks are there for a musical reason so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a crowd of women from the marketplace to return to Paris on 6 October 1789 at Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point a mad goddess displayed the head of a beheaded royal guard at Versailles to the terrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on their foreign-exchange bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the time period of European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The middle phase of the Middle Ages came after the first phase of the High Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism encompasses many ideas, from the technological drive or technological imperative to the narrower sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic coupled with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path dictated by cultural or political influence, and conversely that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the automobile engine necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of owning a car.
Having many machines also leads to many accidents on the roads, and this leads to the invention of new medical techniques to treat damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography arose and these, being in harmony with society, were subject to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris today is known for being the fashion capital, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known to have been a centre of luxury from the 400s to the 1100s.
Its esteem declined in the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was during this period that the title of Capital of Luxury passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may have lagged behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style; one of the major developments of the period was that, following the Crusades, people stopped wearing buttons on their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture focused on producing just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his or her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds from ecological farming combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel disregarded by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished according to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or generated by a particular combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style that includes fashions, mannerisms, and speech.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to point to the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, neglect, or willful abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
These orphans are referred to as "wildlings". Some of them were placed within the boundaries by people (usually their parents); in some cases this abandonment of the nest was due to the parents' rejection of a severely intellectually or physically disabled orphan.
Feral goats may suffer severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or released.
Others are thought to have evolved from animals; some are said to have lived in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the booby exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the animal that raised it, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
What is defined as brainstorming is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to people who are facing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
These so-called scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but is also the graffiti man in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and are intended to discuss, suggest, and explain procedures that may be difficult for the individual student to handle.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring, and nurturing, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster parent should provide any necessities that are missing in the home from which the puppies were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
Distinctive features of the Internet have led to other dimensions of use and openness to gratification.
For example, "learning"" and ""socialization"" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
"Personal involvement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were identified as motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess someone's sincerity.
He even suggests that this ability to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation and session removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements by finding them in available plant resources.
Furthermore, the inability to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes but for primates like us they are difficult to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees still do.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking during the normal sleep duration and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively scientific wake-up to bring you back to unconsciousness without waking you completely.
If you find yourself repositioning the monitor while sleeping, it may be positioned on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to study it.
Other biorhythm-only options involve consuming lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that characterizes a person is related to the amount of tension present in the body and spirit.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find ultimate peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded through the Mahayana path of love and through many techniques typical of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are opened, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading the USSR and the United States to collaborate. By the end of the war, clashes of system, process, and culture caused the nations to decline.
Within two years of the war's end, the former allies were enemies, and the Cold War ended.
It would rage for the next 40 years and be fought for real by proxy armies and battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed and the only hope remained to retreat and regroup along the Romanian front.
However, these plans had already become obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The role of navies has traditionally been to ensure that the nation maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were seeking to move men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was actively trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany probably would have been able to conquer England as it had the rest of Europe.
Horses appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used to keep them for milk, wool, meat and fur.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often controlled by goatherds who were often fat and hairy, similar to the better-known shepherds. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagons had already been built in England in the 16th century.
Although the carriages were mostly wooden planks placed side by side, it allowed the horses pulling them to go faster and to pull heavier loads than on the unpaved roads of the time.
Trusses were installed almost immediately to hold the tracks in place; however, it gradually became apparent that the tracks would be better off with an iron bar on top.
This became common practice, but the iron undid the wooden wheels of wagons.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron ones, and the first all-iron railway was built in 1767.
The earliest form of transport was on foot, humans began walking on two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
The earlier ones, the Australopithecines, generally did not walk.
The characteristic bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus probably walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can choose to live better with the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can even become more active in trying to alleviate future suffering in some way.
In many cases, this is how we treat the symptoms. However, if we only want a temporary solution, we now need to find the cause of the problems and solve them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological progress, and the problems have become even bigger due to humanity's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight, they made between 150 and 200 copies of what became known as the "Dunlap leaflets".
The document's first public reading was given by John Nixon on the lawn of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap folios that are known to still exist are the oldest copies of this document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists still believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them bones.
Many people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about bones that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scales and limbs, lay eggs, and walk upright like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers today rely on its manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Un nùmaro binario el ga soło uno de do vałori, par exenpio 0 o 1, e sti nùmari i xe indicà co cifre binarie, o bit, par doparar el gergo informàtego.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible; symptoms such as vomiting are general enough to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of a green medicine box or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to that particular poison.
The word hymen is used informally by entomologists for this group of insects.
It derives from ancient familiarity with bed bugs that they are insects adapted to infest humans.
Roof tiles and bed tiles are niche, suitable for living in a barn or guest house.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Researchers have found that females are twice as likely to get MS as males.
A couple may decide that having a child is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of the child.
These couples may decide to try to adopt a child.
In an adoption, the natural parents' rights end so that another couple can act as foster parents.
The main goal of science is to understand through the scientific method how the world works. This method in fact drives almost all scientific discovery.
But it is not just experimentation, and an experiment is evidence that if used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, including asking questions and observations guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, his Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
Once decadent to Greek knowledge, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological feedback.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological reagents are self-sustaining oscillators that will exhibit a free-cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was made of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
I did two experiments by tagging the phage DNA with a radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the amount of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism appeals to people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from rural villages to work and are passed by others who go to work where they have just left.
In this transportation system everyone is connected in some way and supports a transportation system based on their private cars.
Science now says that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation. Almost everyone complains about transportation.
Similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they have problems every day? Don't transportation engineers understand anything? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can roughly be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road structures.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings straight over their bodies.
This allows them to hide from predators in many small places.
Also, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are moths and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some thought this was true but others thought the opposite, that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (as well as some other stars).
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't look like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, with more than eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river, measuring six miles wide at some points.
As much as 20 percent of the river water that ends up in the world's oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid construction flourished until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical excellence in their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were well over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people, making it the world's smallest independent country and the least densely populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language in common use by almost all those working in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, because these could be found in nature in authentic form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made from a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
And alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as gold and silver.
There may also be alloys that have small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that thousands of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing systems, the pencil fell into disuse.
People now write messages on computer screens, they don't need a pencil sharpener.
One wonders what the keyboard will be like when something new comes out.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Nuclear fission absorbs some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to split with little or no propulsion.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner below the seas and thicker below the plateaus.
There may have been seas on the near side because the crust is thinner; it took longer for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories center on his search for what makes people angry or pleased.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized by becoming adults.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them desire the things they do and what it is about their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors may emerge when managers fail to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is seeking to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become "an unrecognizable individual who feels they have to change everything the team did and make it their own".
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to arguments between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than normal team members because their teams can be located in different time zones that may not be understood by the local administration.
An equally unique component of a virtual team is the presence of a real "invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The "invisible team"" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? Innovation is a goal of implementing organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are put to good use across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be seen.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational openness.
Angel (2006) says that the Continuum approach is a method that is used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to probing its knowledge, thereby narrowing the area of investigation and making it much more precise.
The correlation between behavioral and behavioral behavioral pathology supports scientists in this research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and cancer affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and investigate never-before-seen service structures and processes.
This gives us a lot of information and material to make simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI is somewhat fanciful, it is a very important part of computer science, and deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
The study of AI concerns the realization of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnosis and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
These things became separate disciplines, focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are still often used in business, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they have been incorporated into many home computer and video game applications.
Field trips are very important for every classroom. Many times the teacher would like to take their students to places where it is not possible to go by bus.
Technology provides a solution to this with virtual field trips. Students can view works in a museum, visit an aquarium, or view art in a classroom.
Sharing a trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina make a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online as a web album.
Blogs can also help students write better. While students often hide their blogging experience with grammatical errors and misspelled words, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, bloggers strive to write better and avoid criticism.
In addition, keeping a blog "pushes students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to arouse public interest inspires students to be better and more interesting (Toto, 2004).
Un blog el xe un strumento che ispira ła cołaborasion e spinge i studenti a estender l'aprendimento ben oltre ła normałe giornata de scoła.
Proper use of blogs "may push students to become more analytical and critical; with active responses to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of what others write as well as describe their personal perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful and bilingual capital city and has many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more makes Ontario seem quintessentially Canadian to outsiders.
Many areas even further north are sparsely populated and some are almost entirely uninhabited wilderness areas.
A population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and is a continent in its own right in terms of wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known for luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought with them Islam, which was especially successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism ended in the 15th century, with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama finding the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region borders the Sahel and to the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is better that every woman who travels says she is married, whether it is true or not.
I'd better bring a ring too (as long as it doesn't look like a ski thing).
Women need to understand that cultural differences may be what they perceive as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, touched, grabbed, etc.
You have to be firm in saying no to men, and not be afraid to assert your reasons (cultural differences or not, it's not fair!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used as a strategic port, called Anfa, by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese dismantled and rebuilt it as the Casa Branca only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, pottery, hookahs and a variety of snacks, but they are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by the Nyiragongo volcano which burned most of the city streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any further trips out of Goma need to be prepared in order to understand the state of the fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest gorilla-watching expeditions in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
As well as being relatively difficult to reach, "Timbuktu"" has become more of a metaphor for exotic and distant places".
Also, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its fame makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was featured in the PBS special The Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, having a more Arab than African charm.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the symbol of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all of South Africa's National Parks, there are daily park and conservation entry fees.
It might be a good idea to buy a Wild Card, which gives you access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the most visited place by tourists.
The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been compared to a shimmering bar graph, recognizable by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, drive to the island and walk to Kowloon on the waterfront on the other side.
Much of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is heavily built on reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is where the British colonialists first settled and so if you want to see something of the territory's colonial past this is a good place to stop.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) across Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they also contain remnants of the great forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is wetland.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and there are now an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 white-tailed deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most departures, particularly those to the east and to Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is best to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and durable.
I taxi condivisi i xe un mexo de trasporto vecio e comodo pa 'ndare in posti visini, come Paro (No. 150) e Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock Bridge is a road bridge across the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The air draft under the bridge is 50 feet (15 m). Construction was completed in August 2011, and it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge has been operational since September 2017, with Brazilian customs checkpoints completed.
The Guarani were the most significant ethnic group inhabiting Eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "the giant province of the Indies" arose as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadores and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best football teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Higher level tournaments and matches are also played at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy polo game tickets, visit the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set as equivalent to that of the British Pound (GBP).
Cheques can be exchanged on the islands' only bank located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley shopping and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in the outer islands, although British and American currencies may be acceptable; check with the bank in advance to see what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures over 30 degrees are common.
Winters can be disappointingly cool; temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it seem colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's mammals are accustomed to humans, the wildlife is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from any other wild animals!
No matter how tame the dogs, bison, deer, elk, bears, and any other large animals may attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous so please respect their space.
Additionally, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep base camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to dock.
All ships were sunk except one British ocean liner; only 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the assassination of the great Tupua Tamasese chief Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is located between two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It is mostly sandy beaches, with a rich shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the Mission Bay and St Heliers ski areas of central Auckland.
There are squares for families sometimes with lots of people, with many shops. It is not safe.
The main local beer is "Number One"", not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called ""Manta""".
There are many French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian ones might be better.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink but bottled water is easy to find if you are not careful.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white"" coffee is foreign. A short black is an ""espresso"", the cappuccino is filled to the brim with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standard. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and reef-related injuries are rare.
However, follow directions from authorities, obey signs, and heed safety signals.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770; they can sometimes be found outside of these periods.
Sharks do exist but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and the open ocean.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat being river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the security and peace of mind that there will be a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can also book other places to stay, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
I agenti de viajo speso i ofre pacheti che i include colazion, opsion de trasporto da/a l'aeroporto o anca pacheti combinadi volo e hotel.
They can also put your reservation on hold if you need time to think about it or get documents for your arrival (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests, however, should first go through the agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site and most of these consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you should get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that even if the music on the main stage has ended there may be parts of the festival where it plays late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check where the cabin is, as going through the ice causes a horrible noise for everyone involved.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check regulations).
Casinos often go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by patrons; windows and clocks are often absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep customers happy and keep them spending money.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, sleet, or subzero temperatures.
On gravel and dirt roads, grip is low and you can't drive like you would on asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall to block you in a short time.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling snow or condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in its popular usage refers to travel overland to view the incredible African wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Certain animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach the machines and standard equipment allows good vision.
The lions, cheetahs and leopards in the caves are shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
Un safari a piedi (dito anca "bush walk", "hiking safari" o "footing") consiste in un'escursione a piedi, o par qualche ora o par diversi giorni da.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you book your flight and hotel for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may find yourself in a tricky situation.
Cancellation rules vary, but as of March the cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most events are expected to cost 2,500 to 130,000 yen, with the typical ticket selling for 7,000 yen.
Ironing soft clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available for loan, although one is missing from the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't want to iron on flat surfaces, you can use a curling iron, if available.
It attempts to prevent the tissue from becoming a hot mass (which could cause it to become hotter or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain types of threats.
In some areas watering for one minute is sufficient, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you should have a problem you may want to consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may pick up parasites that they were not familiar with in their place of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Widespread infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that make people sick or bite them with force usually do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping represents the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt and can be found in certain specific locations.
Travelers coming from countries with other taxes can sometimes get a good deal of tax breaks especially for products like alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont features the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, which frequently passes through isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be warned: steep slopes, narrow lanes and dry curves predominate.
The posted speed limits are considerably more basic than in previous and subsequent sessions - commonly 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and compliance with these limits is somewhat more important than in other circumstances.
Curiously, however, the ring of the telephone is much louder here than on other sections of the route, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with ripe apples present in the dessert throughout the year, and apricots and cherries popping up out of season.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, walnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are often accompanied by strong coffee.
If you want dark but rich pastries, try what is locally called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish of herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry"" or ""mojo"" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that includes a wide variety of regional cuisines found across the country.
But, when used without other adjectives, the term tends to mean the food originating from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Widely available across the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a spectrum of simple spicy dishes, with the main spices that Javanese enjoy being bajji, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang low on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability to the rider but can present safety issues due to the potential for a rider to become trapped.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged off if the horse stops running. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions must be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety coffins that prevent the stirrup from falling off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of granite walls and cliffs.
Climbs include breathtaking views from the peaks.Climbers from all over the world continually establish new routes through its endless wall potential.
Downhill winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboard barefoot.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiastic travelers, sometimes called "ski fanatics", who plan entire vacations to ski at a specific location.
The concept of skiing is very old - caves representing skiers date back as far as 5,000 BC!
Ski mountaineering as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also called ski touring, ski mountaineering or ski touring.
It is related to but usually does not include ski mountaineering or mountaineering, as the latter two activities take place on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as similar to a similar hiking trail.
With good fitness you can cover more ground than walking - but you will rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on rocky tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to submit many visa applications and having your passport checked on many occasions.
The Schengen Area, however, acts as a single country in this regard.
While you are in this zone you can generally cross borders without passport control.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa to visit each Schengen member separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what handmade goods qualify as antiques; some tax agencies define goods more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, with the age limit being lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be defined as antiques even if they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer primarily as pack animals.
Today, many Sami practice modern crafts, and tourism provides an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and unfair persecution of Roma.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel warning, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult advice from governments other than your own, but these may only be aimed at their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
News reports are usually a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The facts they present are often quick, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information that is available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are forms of severe weather, as are storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena can include storms, blizzards, hail, and sandstorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting the area they are visiting as this may alter their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that might be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "Hostile Environment Course"" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course normally covers all the issues we have discussed here in much greater detail, usually with examples of practical experience.
A course normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning to change their gender abroad should ensure that they carry valid documents for their return.
The willingness of governments to issue gender-neutral (x) passports or updated documents with name and preferred gender varies.
The willingness of governments to accept these documents is equally variable.
Security checkpoints have become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people prior to surgery should not be expected to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the return flow from waves breaking on a beach, often on a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology the return flow is concentrated in the shallowest parts, and there a fast current to depth can form.
Most deaths occur as a result of the strain of trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you emerge from the current, getting back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head to places where you won't be rescued or, depending on your skills or whether you've been spotted or not, you may have to wait for rescue.
Return shock comes before culture shock (there is no "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have been slow to adapt to the new culture of the times find it difficult to readjust to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you adapt to the new culture and lose some of your old culture's habits.
If you are traveling for the first time, people are likely to be patient and understanding, as they know that travelers have to adapt to a new country.
No one expects that patience and understanding will also be needed here for the travelers returning home.
The pyramid's light and sound show is one of the area's main attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them silently before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is just like a ledger.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of bases, with active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception Island where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula Mountains here merge with the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 225-mile (360 km) chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, through which the Minnesota River flows.
The northern part of Sentinel Bay is home to Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, with the 4,892 m (16,000 ft) peak of Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be your only choice.
A satellite phone generally does not replace your mobile phone, as to use the former you must be out with a clear line to the satellite to dial.
The service is often used for deliveries, including shipping, and shipping that requires remote data and voice.
Your local provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a gap year before university without compromising their studies.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can improve your chances of getting a higher education in your home country.
There is typically a fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a good place for boating. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has a number of islands in the lakes and archipelagos along the coast.
In archipelagos and lagoons a yacht is not really necessary.
Although the archipelagos off the coast and the larger lakes are large enough for yachts, a boat trip or even a kayak is a completely different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand but is otherwise fairly unique (in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Many of the typical Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia,
This means that you can visit the historic center for a couple of days and return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you disembark via cruise excursions you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As you can see from the map, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never travelled before or have had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and aversions to many things that everyone has.
For some, understanding something about how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown and not being in control.
Couriers are well paid for delivering goods quickly. Time is often of the essence for travel documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger airlines have their own planes, but for other routes and more there was a problem.
If they sent the goods by air freight, on some routes it could take days to clear unloading and customs.
The only way to make it easier was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, which is where you come into play.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to haul a ski boat for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for you).
However, it is not necessarily cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times what you pay in economy for business, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no reason to look for business class or first class discounts on direct flights between A and B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member.
Economic channels were re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The most common religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest seaport after Istanbul, and a major transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center, set around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Broad avenues, modern glass buildings and shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

To the north, within easy reach is the romantic and alluring town of Sintra, made famous to outsiders after a sensational account of its splendours was written by Lord Byron.
El Scotturb Bus 403 viaja regolarmente a Sintra, fermandose a Cabo da Roca.
In the north also visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Templo), a place famous worldwide for apparitions of the Madonna.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, and also a site of incalculable significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who spent time suffering there, and many more who saw their loved ones slaughtered or worked to exhaustion there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. It is not making jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
It is not defacing the site with marks or scratches on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, and a vast majority understand it, and virtually all know Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only indicated in Catalan as it is firmly established as the first official language.
Yet Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other services.
Regular announcements in the metro are only given in Catalan, but special notices are called by an automatic system in several languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often a mistaken stereotype, the best way to get around Paris is to behave as well as possible, as someone who is "bien élevé"" (well brought up). This will make orientation relatively easy.
Parisian prejudices will quickly evaporate if you show basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is largely forested, mainly with beech and fir trees and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly wide variety of plant communities due to its spectrum of microclimates, diverse soils, and varying elevation levels.
This area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare wildlife can be found, including the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie, along with many other common species.
While visiting the monasteries, women are expected to wear skull cups as well as hip and shoulder pads.
Most monasteries provide hats for women who arrive without one, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Along the same lines, men are required to wear pants that cover their ankles.
These can also be borrowed from the cloakroom at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use so you may feel uncomfortable wearing them.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of other areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially beef), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple and popular snack, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and available seasonings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It may also make reading easier, although writing is a bit more complicated since one has to discover whether a verb or adjective is used with a noun form.
Pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian because almost all words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to be avoided are c and g, as their pronunciation changes with the following vowel.
Remember also to pronounce the r and rr differently: in Venetian they are pronounced together, but not in Italian.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
So reading this grammar guide will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understanding expressions.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easy.
However, people with some knowledge of Spanish may quickly come to the conclusion that there is no need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually now obsolete, remaining as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution at their peak was not the problem that it is today, they are often located in cities or on university campuses, which are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The sight of cherry blossoms, called hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were preferred.
In Japan, the first flower festivals were held by the emperor alone for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look better when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick "just one" specimen.
If you are to visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens"" will result in you being expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and an easy place to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But being in the tropics just a few degrees north of the Equator you will have to deal with heat (always) and scorching sun (with clear skies, more rarely).

Check that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to base a holiday.
For example visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also designate routes for popular cycling or hiking trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays, and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending New Year's Eve somewhere green to watch the sunrise.
There are obviously Christian explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Many Christian churches often celebrate Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often joining to celebrate at midnight to commemorate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on islands did so either by swimming, flying or gliding.
Because of the long distance from the mainland mammals could not make the journey making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced: horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky is dark most of the day.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you can still enjoy the summers.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might expect.
Jacket and tie are standard attire, and colleagues address each other by surname or title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, and emphasizes group effort rather than recognizing individual accomplishments.
Workers often must obtain their superior's approval for every decision they make, and are expected to obey their superior's instructions without question.
