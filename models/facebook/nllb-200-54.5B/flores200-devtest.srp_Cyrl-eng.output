Although an experimental vaccine appears to be effective in reducing Ebola mortality, so far no drug has proved sufficiently effective in treating the existing infection.
An antibody cocktail called ZMapp initially showed promise but official studies showed that it was not as effective in preventing Ebola mortality as expected.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that the researchers used it as a starting point and compared it to three other treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that in the interest of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, it would be better to proceed with significant changes within our organization rather than decertification.

Besides confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely accepted theory, this provides details that fossils cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but have other features of feathers - spines and quills - the researchers concluded that the rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used not for flight but for temperature regulation and pointing. The researchers' view is that although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen suggests that it is the feather of an adult, not a juvenile.
The researchers noted that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not bird feathers.
A car bomb that exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two policemen and injured more than 20 others.

The brightness and rotation are used together to determine the star's Rosby number, which refers to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in the domain of its magnetic reversal.

The work done is mostly theoretical, but the program is written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
In the same way that the moon pulls on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter just as ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in the form of a halo, and is made up of many tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal area of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new strain is "extremely problematic and disturbing because of the high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll thinks that some patients may have been infected in the hospital, and at least two were hospital health workers.
Over the course of a year, an infected person may infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total TB population still appears to be low - 6,000 out of 330,000 people infected at any one time in South Africa.

Infrared images showing differences in temperature between day and night indicate that these are most likely caves.
"During the day they are cooler than the adjacent surface, while at night they are warmer.
"Their thermal behavior is not as constant as in large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it's clear that this is the case given that these are deep holes in the ground", said Glenn Cushing of the U.S. Geological and Astrogeological Survey team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been very simple in terms of technology: voters sit alone in a booth and place a printed ballot marked with the chosen candidate in an envelope.
Once officials verify a voter's identity, he or she puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The electoral law of France very strictly codifies the protocol.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend every part of the process. In the evening volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with her son's murder at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised as her picture has been published in many media outlets.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observed: "Journalists seem to be walking a fine line if they publish pictures of suspects or anything else"
The Scottish Public Prosecution Service, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, told reporters there would be no further comment at least until charges are laid.
According to leaked information, the document will refer to the discussion of borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other subjects discussed reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees that this presence exists for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control action were to be under the strict supervision of the ranger, as the action was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Thanks to a partnership between the NPWS and a corporation called the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers are hired as part of the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mike Offlin, acting director of parks and heritage protection for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
The new Electoral Commission (CEP) of nine members was sworn in yesterday under Martelly.
This is Martelly's fifth election commission in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry reported that it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "minor".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (09:19 pm Friday GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are now confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the elderly lady's place as she needed to use the restroom.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins began to pursue a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that if hormones were administered, fetal lung maturation would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes", which contain flight records.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night two months ago. Pretty unique look for her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was just as weird as me...maybe more...I love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100- and 200-meter freestyle events in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints raised doubts about his fitness.
He could not take the painkillers he needed because they are banned at the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water that came to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have collided with the Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed legislation last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There is public speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year as well as reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to earlier ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to determine the precise position of aircraft and to provide pilots with more accurate data.
No additional transport put on overground trains will stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available above ground.
Fear of lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without fans of the team.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reports the creation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to take much longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes.
It can be machined into thin wire, which can be twisted or braided, and can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made in a very thin form as well as glued to some other metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate pictures in books known as "illustrated (illuminated) manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been stripped (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every home, which were connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In Roman civilization, toilets were once part of public baths, where men and women were in the same society together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and then brings it back down almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images.
Sending a satellite or a telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet high.
The bicycle has changed the world in amazing ways. The greatest thing the bicycle has done for us is to make transportation much easier and faster.
This brought us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the ecological niche, a special job that each cat performs that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, and they live in large groups known as prides.
Packs consist of one to three adult males in a kinship, along with as many as thirty females and juveniles.
Females are usually closely related to one another, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of a tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion but is more like a sentence full of scathing, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can.
Scientists think that ocelots track and search for animals to eat (prey) by scent, by smelling the ground where they have been.
Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then stalking their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return) it will often find itself in an environment different from what it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different rivals, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger rival than previously needed.
The original population has not changed one bit, and they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after many thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its day, and they feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set of teeth on the hard palate, meaning that nothing in its path could escape.
Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a huge dinosaur like the T-rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual things of their own to feast upon, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a pouch.
Another difference was that while poor men and women would eat their meals seated on stools, the rich preferred to host banquets where they would recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a primary temple that was viewed as the house of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to appease the deities by performing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in front and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could go.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not of great importance.
Much of the daily life of a Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open stalls overlooking the street.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were numerous differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at some point early in its history, this large parchment document (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Well, most likely the label was added purely as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was led by the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and allied themselves with them instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion codenamed "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together, i.e. a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also defines the size of a community.
Civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, and so are often not recognized as true civilizations.
While the War of Independence was being fought, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state governments, which were often uncooperative in enforcing all its legal documents.
It also had no right to strike down tax laws and tariffs between states.
Unanimous approval by all the states was required before changes in membership could be made, and the states so readily grasped the central administration that their representatives were often absent from meetings.
The Italian national football team was, along with the German national football team, the second most successful team in the world and were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games or Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical depictions.
The origins of Taiwan go back as far as the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation of Aboriginal grain production practices, and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
Following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, granting Japan sovereignty over Taiwan, which it ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio has inherited the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is considered to be 3:2 (divided by 12 to give the simplest ratio in the form of an integer).
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or nearly approximate this size.
Often abused and often ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the picture.
It states that the most prominent place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that vertically and horizontally divide the picture into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For thousands of years, the Christian religion had bound the nations of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
With its inexhaustible power, it has affected everyone, from kings to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off the flow of key military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the ocean, thus endangering even neutral shipping.
Since responses to this tactic were limited, Germany expected a similar response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
To accept a job with the New York Edison Company, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each period of China or each ruling family represented a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable age of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous period of all was the Three Kingdoms era that lasted sixty years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce warfare raged between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China.
There are many social and political outcomes such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Also after the revolution, the professions were open to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true in the military, for instead of rank being based on class, it is now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that were outside his ordinary life. He would often go to meditate in the cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (light).
The cave itself, which has survived various periods, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is difficult to find, even if one knows it exists.
Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of a number of large pyramid structures honoring a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "bow" designation looks like a V, and the "bowline" designation looks like a staple or a square with a missing bottom.
"Up" means that you should start at the top and push the string, while "down" means that you should start at the fretboard (where your hand holds the string) and pull the string.
Raising the drums usually produces a quieter sound, while lowering the drums produces a louder and more assertive one.
Feel free to pencil in your markings, but remember that the printed string marks are there for musical reasons and should usually be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children, 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, as well as the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to retreat to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of women from the marketplace.
They traveled back to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The mob ordered the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point a member of the mob waved to the terrified queen the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to defray most of the costs and interest on securities circulated by Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the enormous profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were the primary gain of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is often called the Late Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which officially ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path that is beyond cultural and political influences and that in turn technology has its "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
Yet, the national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a considerable dose of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and in time customs and cultures related to that geography would emerge, and these, according to the place of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began about 400 and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned, bringing gifts, such as silks and spices, that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of slow channels of communication, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest inventions of the era as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Consumer agriculture is agriculture conducted for the purpose of producing enough food only for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Consumer agriculture is a simple, often organic system, that uses preserved seeds native to a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel left out by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often denote their membership through recognizable and symbolic uses of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at some sad cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or physical abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Some feral children have been imprisoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of children occurs due to the parents' refusal to accept the child's serious intellectual and physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children display behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the animals that cared for them, such as their fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, learning through a "scale" system goes a step further.
Metacognitive support is not a learning method, but rather a support provided to individuals as they go through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is actually a kind of supporter, but also a little man stapler in Microsoft Office.
Virtual supporters are an integral part of the software and are supposed to review, encourage and explain procedures that might be too complicated for students to carry out on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but it happens.
We view the foster care system as a protective zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, ongoing education, and reliable health care.
Family placement of children should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of usage and access to pleasure.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are cited as important purposes for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Aimee and McCord (1998) identified "personal participation" and "maintained connections" as new motivational aspects in researching audience reactions to Web sites.
The use of video recording has led to significant breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that if you correctly interpret microexpressions, you can tell whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately judge sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to understand human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and unhidden.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination result in a constant mixing of variations between the two stocks in each generation.
On the savannah, a primate with a humanlike digestive tract finds it difficult to obtain amino acids from available plant sources.
In fact, failure to do so can have serious consequences: increasing depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources to access were the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have a hard time digesting them unless they're cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digested but also provides a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep paralysis is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be accomplished with a relatively quiet alarm clock that would bring you into a conscious state without fully awakening you.
If you reset the clock during sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in that person's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but these have been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many of the techniques of Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Visualizing various deities clears energy channels, activates chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, conflicts of systems, processes, and cultures led the two countries to quarrel.
Two years after the war ended, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was planned to last 40 years, and the fighting would be real, through conflicts of smaller nations representing the interests of larger military powers, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern areas of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Ocean-going shipping is arguably the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across oceans.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to transport people and goods, while at the same time preventing an enemy from transporting their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began preserving them for easier access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often accompanied by goats that were mostly children or young, similar to the more familiar shepherds.
Wagon roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although early railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horse-drawn wagons to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Railroad ties were introduced fairly early to hold the rails in place; however, it was gradually realized that rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
This became standard practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden chariot wheels.
In time, wooden wheels gave way to iron ones, and in 1767 solid iron rails were used for the first time.
The first known mode of transport was walking. Humans began walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as is common.
Perfecting bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future.
However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we should get to the root of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been compounded by overpopulation and mankind's extravagant life-style.
After passage by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Between 150 and 200 copies, now known as Dunlap Pages, were made overnight.
John Nixon was the first to read this document publicly, on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap manuscripts still known to exist are the oldest extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the handling of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be readily apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to preclude immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term beetle in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient acquaintance with bedbugs, which are insects well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer and common bedbugs are long-term residents, adapted to life in a host's nest or home.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have MS symptoms.
The couple may decide that raising the baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to plan to adopt a baby.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can be the child's parent.
The main task of science is to understand the way the world works using the scientific method. This method actually governs most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were respected.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic biological rhythms that are not simply responses to periodically changing external stimuli have been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with a period of free-running rotation even if there are no external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indicators that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments in which they labeled phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material that is affected, and whether the cells affected are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in the germ cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife.
Field activities include, for example, hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem data.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small rural towns by car to go to their places of employment, passing by those whose place of employment is in the very place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation process, all are somehow connected and support a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this carbon-intensive economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
Similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare in developed lands.
Are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more serious going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be represented roughly mathematically.
To better visualize the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid predators and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings close to their body.
This gives them a greater choice of different small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and water lilies.
Thousands of years earlier, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This sounds reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and the largest river on earth, carrying eight times as much water as the next-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, with a local width of six miles.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans originates in the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 3,980 miles (6,387 km) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids at Giza in their size and technical excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since they can be found in nature in their original form and can be mined relatively easily with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of just one or a few of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This more closely resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, plasma, although he also theorized that these transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that consist of a small amount of nonmetals such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter - all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
Unfortunately, when new writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and was used less.
People now type messages on a computer screen without ever having been near a comma.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will turn into when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works by taking energy to assemble a nucleus of many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, the repeated cracking of the core releases energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar sea and thicker under the hills.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories aim to find out what drives people or what they like.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they mature into adults.
These theories study what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, two patterns of behavior may emerge when managers begin to manage their former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels he has to change everything the team did and make it his own.
After all, it is the leader who is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams need to meet the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a liaison for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can assemble according to different time zones for which local management would have no understanding.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
An "invisible team" is a management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, an organization's process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, narrowing the field and making it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the claims of scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of data and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although AI draws a strong connotation towards science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and client questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been incorporated into several home computers and video game application software.
Often the teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual field trips, where students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Visual sharing of field trip experiences is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year the students of the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is redesigned but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to arouse the interest of an audience inspires students to be smart and interesting. - Toto, 2004.
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to material from the Internet, students can define their own views in the context of others' texts, as well as put forward their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and it has an array of art galleries and museums that depict Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, while to the north is the haven of unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this further highlights Ontario as something foreigners consider basically Canadian.
Large areas farther north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island and is a continent of wilderness in itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was largely adopted in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female passengers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
Wearing a ring (just not one that looks too expensive) is also helpful.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to follow, hold hands, etc.
Be firm in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and it was also used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and even the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru el-Badiya, and Spanish merchants who established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping cities in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a variety of trinkets, but these are all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside Goma should be well researched to understand the state of the fighting that is still going on in North Kivu province.
This town is also the base for a hike up the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Because of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
Threatened by desert sand, Timbuktu was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stops during the filming of "Wonders of the African World", on PBS.
This city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each containing different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the main attraction of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily fees for conservation and park entry.
Consideration should also be given to purchasing a wild card, which allows entry into certain South African parks or into all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is what many tourists consider its main focal point.
The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a shimmering ribbon chart made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of the urban part of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This place was claimed by British colonists, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining virgin jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is covered by water bodies.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intermediate bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and Jakhar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most prefectures are served by Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Taxi sharing is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, and the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when customs checkpoints on the Brazilian side are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of India", was founded in the 16th century as a result of encounters between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For all tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FRF) whose value is set equivalent to the value of one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley across the street from FIC West.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine which method of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; temperatures over 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel much colder than the thermometer says.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park service, keep at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife!
Despite their gentle appearance, bison, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other game, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has officially been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk, and nearly two hundred American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Le'olofi III.
Since Auckland is spread over two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular being in three areas:
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy with safe bathing areas, and most have shade that makes trees sway.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are in the Waitematā Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, and with a rich array of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer "Number One" is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines that are good to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines may fare better.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
To Australians, "white double espresso with milk" coffee is a foreign concept. The short black is "espresso", the cappuccino comes with heavy cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards; the fruit juices are expensive but exquisite.
Many trips to the reef are organized throughout the year, and injuries resulting from any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, accept the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and heed safety warnings.
Square jellyfish appear near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of the town of 1770.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim far away from you.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking ahead gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through them.
Travel agents usually offer arrangements that include breakfast, secure transportation to/from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel arrangements.
They can also save your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or can obtain other documents you need for the destination you are visiting (e.g. a visa).
Any supplement or claim should first be sent to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider this a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to arrive early to secure a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stages may have stopped, there may be parts of the festival where music is played late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic during the winter, check the location of the cabin, as the passage through the ice makes rather ghastly noises for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check requirements).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by patrons.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and to keep them coming back.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is poor and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to leave you stranded.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or flying snow, as well as fog or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic flows largely uninterrupted year-round.
A safari is probably the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to overland journeys in which you can see fascinating African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars slowly, so standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "nature walk", "walking safari" or "walking tour") consists of a walk, lasting a couple of hours or a couple of days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Expected ticket prices for most events will range between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with typical tickets priced around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels rent irons and ironing boards, even if you do not have them in your room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are a number of ways to purify water, some more effective than others.
In some areas one minute of boiling water is sufficient; in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, then you should consider buying water from reputable companies in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter animals and pests unfamiliar to their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable sums of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, as it often passes through isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared to react quickly: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves dominate.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the earlier and later sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict observance is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, the mobile-phone network is much stronger here than along many other sections of the road, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples baked throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try what is called a berliner, a fankuchen, or a kraffen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Since it encompasses 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines throughout the country.
But if used without further qualification, the term usually denotes food originating from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine contains a notable array of simply spiced dishes, among which prevail flavors preferred by Javanese such as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Uzenji are footrests for the rider that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but can pose a safety problem because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider has been thrown from a horse but his leg is caught in the rein, he may be dragged if the horse continues to run.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots, with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety barriers that allow the leather strap to fall from the saddle if pulled by the rider at the moment of fall.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly charting new routes through the unfathomable potential of foreign mountains.
Snow mountain sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending down snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main activity during the trip, and many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums", plan entire vacations spent skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is extremely old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is often referred to as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski walking.
It is related to but usually does not include ski touring or alpine-style mountaineering; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much sturdier skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat more distance than by walking - but you will rarely reach the speed of Nordic skiing without a heavy pack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean that you would have to go through visa requirements and passport control several times.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area functions much like a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply separately for visas for each of the Schengen member states, which saves time, money, and avoids paperwork.
There is no universal definition by which manufactured items are considered antiques; some tax agencies define products more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit might be shorter in places such as North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than some similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is important to the lives of the Lapps, and commercial farming is also important to many in other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami were heavily dedicated to reindeer husbandry, but lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and used reindeer mainly for hauling and carrying loads.
Today, many Lapps are engaged in modern crafts, and tourism is an important source of income in Lapland.
Although common, especially outside the Roma community, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it evokes negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma.
If the country you will be visiting becomes subject to travel recommendations, it is possible that this will have an impact on your health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may also want to listen to advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different scenarios than Europeans or Arabs.
Reports are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and simplistic compared with the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or lead to loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather in the area, as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone wishing to travel to a country that could be called a war zone would first have to undergo professional training.
If you type "hostile environment course" into an Internet search engine, you will likely get the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, mainly with practical experience.
The course will usually last from 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must be sure to carry valid documents for their return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not specify a person's sex (X) or documents that have been updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies equally.
Checks at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Preoperative transgender persons should not expect to be allowed to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are a return current from waves breaking away from a beach, often present at a reef or similar locations.
Because of the underwater topology, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper parts and there a fast current can be generated to the deep water.
Most deaths result from fatigue while trying to swim upstream, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim somewhere where you will not be caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted, you may want to wait to be rescued.
Return shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adjust to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have lost some of your native habits.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, recognizing that travelers have to adapt to a new land.
People may not expect that travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show in the pyramid is one of the most interesting things here for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually there is always the sound of tourists and vendors.
The Sphinx is set as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are depicted on the pyramids and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the most bases there, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the peninsula's mountains merge into the plateau and then re-emerge to form the 360 km (220 mi) chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Vinson reaching 4,892 m (16,000 ft).
In remote areas without mobile-phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a cell phone, since to make a call, you must be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is often used when traveling by ship, including yacht, as well as for expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and study.
This is especially popular with school leavers, as it allows them to take a year off before college without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a gap year can improve prospects of progressing to higher education in the country of origin.
There is usually a tuition fee to enroll in some of these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent sailing destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes you do not need a yacht.
Although the offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This corresponds to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise very unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is from one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises have an extended stay in Saint Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and return and sleep on the boat overnight.
If you go ashore only as part of a boat excursion, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all backgrounds and age groups, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes about other things that so many people have.
For some, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help them overcome fears based on the unknown or the inability to control events.
Time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for some other routes or for smaller firms it was a problem.
If they sent items by air freight, some routes may have taken days to clear customs.
Airline regulations won't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to set aside a fat stack of money for the privilege (or, better yet, to get the company you work for to do it for you).
However, this does not come cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more than a regular economy ticket for business, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point even in asking for discounts on business and first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
This conflict resulted in the creation in 1994 of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member.
Economic ties were re-established between the two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as a very good transport hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is today a modern, developed, bustling commercial center situated on a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Broad boulevards, glass-walled buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, though the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the portico of the church are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some tombs.
It is worth spending half an hour strolling through the intriguing countryside.
To the north and nearby is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, made famous to outsiders after Lord Byron recorded a glowing account of its wonders.
The Scaturb bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (the Shrine), a place known worldwide for the Virgin Mary's instructions.
Please keep in mind that you are visiting a site of mass graves, as well as a place of almost incalculable significance to much of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their stay here, and many more whose loved ones were killed or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this site with the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by making markings or engraving graffiti on objects.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, since it is established by law as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unscheduled outages are announced automatically in a number of languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, unfriendly, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to behave well - like someone who is "bien élevé".
Unfriendly Parisian behavior quickly evaporates if you show a little basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an exceptionally wide range of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, varying soils, and varying levels of elevation.
The area is also home to a remarkable variety of animals and birds.
Rare animal species can be found here, including the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and great bustard, as well as many common species
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knees as well as cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries have provided skirts for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own skirt, especially with bright colors, you will trick a smile into the face of the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same rule, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow these from the supply at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each wear, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like those of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available accompaniments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word "Sie", meaning "you", are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It can also be said to facilitate reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or a preposition is used in the pronoun form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The basic letters to watch for are c and g, since their pronunciation varies according to the accompanying consonant.
Also, try to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "karo" means dear, while "carro" means chariot.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and mostly correct grammar.
Hence, reading this grammar book would help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to understand phrases better.
Needless to say, if you speak a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough not to have to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are largely obsolete today, existing as museums or educational places.
As light pollution in their heyday was not the problem it is today, they can usually be found in cities or on campuses, where they were more easily accessible than those built in the modern era.
Most modern telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hana, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China where plum blossoms were the flowers of choice.
In Japan the first cherry blossom celebrations were arranged by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural setting, so resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formal garden, collecting "samples" will also get you kicked out, no questions asked.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and is very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything on arrival.
But since it is located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with both heat (always) and bright sunshine (when the sky is clear, which is rarely).
A couple of buses also go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron itself and not just to the nearby Jewish neighborhood of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for vacation planning.
For example, a visit to the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting places on the Danube or a boat ride along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many Christmas traditions have been adopted by nonbelievers in Christendom and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in an open area to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is quite possible that this ritual of spring and fertility predates Christianity.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday evenings during Easter weekend, while communities often start the celebration as soon as midnight strikes to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
The great distance from the continent prevented mammals from traveling, making the giant tortoise the primary animal to graze in the Galapagos.
Since man's arrival on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during the winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, since the sky will be dark more or less throughout the day.
Since areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is hierarchical and more formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are a business dress code, and colleagues address one another by their surname or title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than singling out individual accomplishments.
Workers often have to seek approval from superiors for every decision made, and they are expected to follow directions from superiors without question.
