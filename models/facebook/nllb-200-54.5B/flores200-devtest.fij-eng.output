This not only confirms that some dinosaurs were feathered, a popular theory, but also provides information that the fossil record rarely provides, such as color and shape in three dimensions.
According to scientists, the animal's fur has a feathery outer layer and a bright inner layer.
These findings have raised some interesting questions about the evolution of feathers.
Because the dinosaur's coat, called the rachis, was not yet fully formed and contained other vertebrae - barbs and barbules - researchers thought that the rachis evolved from these later vertebrae.
Some of these appendages indicate that they were used not for flight but for warmth or display, suggesting that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, it shows signs of having evolved from an adult rather than a chicken.
They point out that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the pattern indicates that it is part of an adult animal and not a chicken.

Approximately 60 cases of iPods overheating and malfunctioning were reported, causing six fires and injuring four people.
According to Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI), 27 accidents involving these devices have been reported.
Last week, Apple announced that it had also reported 34 cases of overheating, which the company called a "minor problem".
In response, the ministry described Apple's renewed decline as "deeply regrettable".
An earthquake was felt in the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Relief Committee reports no damage or casualties.
The Tsunami Warning Center also said that red waves were not expected.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a sacked policeman arrested a group of Congolese tourists who had hijacked a bus.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on the tourists with his M16.
Most of the hostages were later released, but six have been identified so far.
Six detainees, including children and the elderly, were immediately released, including the Filipino photographers.
The photographer substituted a young girl for the photographer because he wanted to take a shortcut.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a physician.
She trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and started work at Auckland Women's State Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching obstetrics in his spare time.
His research showed that the release of certain hormones can accelerate the development of a baby's liver and fetus.
Government scientists reported two 'black boxes' in flight on Wednesday.
Dowsers pay their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that "Luna was the first Queen of Greatness. She was my first manager. Luna died two months ago. She was beautiful. She was strong".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna is as scary as I am...maybe more...love her and miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted in the 2010 pre-election polls, those who opposed direct rule increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said in the lead-up to the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should hold a general election because of the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled favor ending the reign of Queen Elizabeth II of Australia.
At the height of the referendum campaign, 29 percent of those polled in Australia wanted the country to become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia's constitution should remain unchanged.
After winning Olympic gold medals in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and three Commonwealth Games gold medals in the team event, she has been in good health since her injuries.
He was unable to get the drugs he needed to control his pain because they were banned from competition in the Games.
A mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri has determined the largest number of prime numbers that will not be doubled until January 25.
Many people confirmed using different devices and software from the beginning of February and announced on Tuesday.
Extraterrestrial life could also be a source of water transported to Earth by terrestrial plants that could produce proteins and support life.
Scientists hope that it will lead to the formation of other universes, which will compete with the Earth for a long time.
Governor Cuomo, 53, began his first four-year term this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He was referring to "obscene jesting".
He is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is an FAA initiative to allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel annually to reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology rather than ground-based technology so that air traffic controllers can provide pilots with more accurate and precise information.
There is no public transportation that stops at Wembley, and there is no parking or entertainment facilities at the stadium.
Fear of a lack of transportation increases the likelihood that the stadium will close its doors to fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science will establish a new species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden say that the two-generation improvement, which was expected to be long-lasting, is due to the breeding of the Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migrating cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed in a variety of ways.
It can be drawn into thin wires, twisted and knitted, and pounded or pounded into thin sheets.
It can be thinned, glued, or molded to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "storybook illustrations".
This is called the pH of the solution, and it can be measured with the help of red-carpet tests.
The color of fermented wine changes depending on the level of acidity or alkalinity.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (the H in pH) ions present in the sample.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons removed from them (as a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
With clean hands, combine two dry powders, and roll them into a ball.
The water in your hand mixes with the surrounding environment, perhaps forming a funnellike shape.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had household latrines, connected by an elaborate system of aqueducts.
A system of aqueducts has been found in Minoan buildings on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were gardens, and in Roman civilization, communal houses for men and women were built close together.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space pick up the signal and relay it back to earth almost instantaneously.
Satellites have been sent into space by spacecraft or rockets, and telescopes use mirrors because the earth's atmosphere blocks out some of the light that we see.
It takes a giant rocket about 100 feet [30 m] long to launch a telescope into space.
The wheel has revolutionized the world in a marvelous way.
He gave us trains, automobiles, and many other modern means of transportation.
A little farther down, a medium-sized cat was feeding on animals ranging in size from rabbits to antelope to deer.
There are also many small cats (including house cats) that feed on small animals, such as reptiles and small birds, crabs and lobsters, spiders, and birds.
The secret of their success lay in their ability to relate to one another in a mutually supportive, noncompetitive way.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, and they live in groups called prides.
Three male lions and thirty female lions with their cubs were in the den.
Female lions are gregarious, forming extended families of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions look like packs of wolves or dogs, and lions (unlike other big cats) are gregarious by nature and can be dangerous to other animals.
Competitive and well-built in all disciplines, the tiger could climb (not very well), swim, leap great distances and pull with the force exerted by a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not the full roar of a lion but the howl of a mad dog.
The ocelot is a predator, preying on small animals such as lizards, snakes, crabs, and birds.
Researchers believe that ocelots track and locate their prey by scent-marking the ground.
They can see better in the dark because they have night vision, and can navigate by sound, too. Ocelots hunt by camouflaging their appearance to blend in with their surroundings and gliding to catch prey.
When a group of animals (a colony) becomes separated from the main herd (as when climbing over a cliff or crossing a river or moving to a new island where they cannot move freely) they find themselves in a new environment more easily than they were used to.
The new environment would be rich in resources and competitive, and the newcomers would have to adapt to become more competitive than they were before.
The sects that broke away remained essentially unchanged, clinging to the status quo.
In time, as the new group adjusted to their new home, they began to stand out as different from the main body.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups may look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable and essential part of the evolution of life.
Plant roots produce oxygen for humans to breathe, and absorb carbon-dioxide that we exhale.
Plant roots absorb nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses and clothing out of wood, and much of our food comes from the roots of trees, without which the animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the most feared predator of its day, fearing nothing but mosasaurs.
Its long mouth was studded with more than 70 fangs, with another set of fangs on the roof of its mouth, making it virtually invulnerable to attack.
We cannot be sure, but it probably had a forked tongue, and its diet included crabs, large fish, and mosasaurs, as well as fish of the same genus.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even the largest T. rex is no match for it.
While we may be familiar with many of their dishes, the Roman diet included some strange or exotic ingredients, including venomous snakes, spiders, scorpions, and a type of club known as the dormouse.
Another difference was that poor people and women usually sat on couches, while wealthy men reclined on couches.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include European or Asian American foods until centuries later.
For example, they did not eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or beans, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built temples to their various gods and called them households.
The people brought their sacrifices to the god, and the priests administered the gods' wishes in connection with rituals and festivals.
Each temple had a central courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which the priests had access.
Sometimes large dome-shaped structures called ziggurats were built as part of a temple complex.
The rooftops of large buildings served as shrines to the gods.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was a luxury.
Much of family life among the Hebrews took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; storefronts opened onto the street.
The land of Canaan had no forests, so timber was relatively inexpensive.
According to Norse mythology, Erik the Red, driven out of Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland on his northern journey and named it after himself.
Even so, Eskimo tribes lived in the area at the time.
Although all are "Scandinavian", Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland have many differences in their people, rulers, customs, and history.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not the case, for although written records do exist, they are not geologic maps.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the inscription, "Declaration of Independence signed July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows who wrote it, it is known that during its early existence, the text of this large volume (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up and preserved.
The words may simply have been added to give the book its title.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but those in the south remained in exile.
"Vichy" French were defined as French citizens who had apologized to the Germans in 1940 and worked with the war criminals against their opponents.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched Operation Dragoon against southern France.
Within two weeks, American and French troops were liberating southern France and advancing into Germany.
Enlightenment is a quality shared by a large group of people who live and work together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city, or city-state, and indicates the extent of a society.
The city-state constitutes a nation. The enlightenment concept of a civilization refers to the flow of knowledge across generations, a mode of travel that is shared equitably.
Some traditions simply fade away without being distilled into the unconscious evidence needed for enlightenment.
During the Civil War, the thirteen states established a weak federal government - with only one executive branch - under the Articles of Confederation.
In the absence of a legislative or executive branch, the senate had little power to control taxation, relying instead on the legislature, which often ignored national policy.
It does not have the authority to change the tax laws of the states.
The Declaration required the consent of the states before changes could be made, which governments took lightly because representatives from the states were not present on a regular basis.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Other popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are popular in the North, and the Italians are world champions.
Japan consists of some 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's archipelago, Japan is no longer historically referred to as "many islands".
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors crossed the islands and named them Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Danish East India Company established a trading post on the southwestern coast of Taiwan, which began a transition to a wheat-growing system that employed Chinese in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized the western and northern coasts of Taiwan and claimed Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three buildings, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings around the square have been restored to their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, a process that continues to this day.
For example, the world's most popular motion picture format is 35mm, an analog film format.
It is still in use today, and its aspect ratio is the same as that of the digital camera image sensor format.
The actual size of the 35mm, which is 36mm wide and 24mm high, is a bit of a puzzle.
The aspect ratio of this system (divided by twelve to get the smallest number) is said to be 3.2.
Many commonly used formats (the APS family of formats, for example) have the same or close to the same aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds has often been attacked and criticized, but it is a simple guideline to create a variety of activities with forward edges while preserving the order of the columns.
It has been suggested that the best place to photograph an object is at the intersection of two lines that form a triangle, the vertical and the horizontal (see illustration).
In the early days of European history, the Catholic Church had acquired wealth and power and had been widely criticized.
For thousands of years, Christianity held Europe together despite its linguistic and cultural differences.
This universal sovereignty extended from the king to the common people.
However, it is a tenet of the Christian faith that wealth should be used to promote the welfare of the poor and that church funds are available for this purpose.
For a thousand years, Rome maintained direct control over the church, and the centralization of power and money involved caused many to question the practical application of this doctrine.
After the atrocities began, Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The ban on military equipment and government contracts was justified, even though it violated international laws that had been ratified by the major powers over the previous two centuries
Britain guarded its external maritime borders to prevent large ships from entering the high seas and harming even non-combatants.
Little retaliation was anticipated, and Germany expected a similar response from its submarines in the open seas.
During the 1920's, antiwar and isolationism were the order of the day.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I had passed, the nations were anxious to avoid a repetition of such atrocities.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had only four cents, a book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China introduced a new system of representing time; each Chinese era or dynasty was unique.
The Three Kingdoms period is most famous for the 60-year period between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this era, dynastic struggles for supremacy were common.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody period in China's history, with tens of thousands of people dying for the privilege of ruling from the imperial palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political problems, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to a constitutional monarchy, republicanism, nationalism, and the idea that a country belongs to its people rather than to a single ruler.
Similarly, after the war, men were hired to help the industrious ones to improve their skills.
Some joined the military because of the abolition of class distinctions based on personality and achievement.
The war in France inspired many foreign forced laborers to join the revolution.
He often visited a cave that came to be called "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (Light) to pray.
This cave, which has stood the test of time, represents the spiritual life of Muhammad.
Perched high in the mountains north of Mecca, it is the most isolated cave in the world.
Once you enter the cave, you are on your own.
We could see nothing except the clear blue sky and the surrounding mountains, and we could hear and see very little as we stayed in the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, still stands.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century bk, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramids built to commemorate the Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" contains Egypt's earliest monuments and necropolises, including pyramids, many small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The pyramid complex was built in memory of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in memory of Khufu's wife and family.
An up bow is a V-shaped bow, and a down bow is a staple.
Up means to start from the top and push the arrow, and down means to start from the bottom and pull the arrow.
The up-bow produces a gentle sound, while the down-bow is powerful.
Feel free to mark the books, but remember that the printed bowings are for musical purposes and should be respected.
The fearsome King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forcibly taken to Paris from Versailles by a group of prostitutes on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage and were surrounded by a mob shouting insults against the King and Queen.
The crowds kept the windows open for the King and Queen.
On one occasion a royal guard was decapitated at Versailles in the presence of the queen.
The U.S. military occupation of the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to finance a large part of the cost and profits of the treaties signed by the Philippine government and Wall Street banks.
Nevertheless, the rapid growth of the Filipino expansionism led to a significant increase in American colonization.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the inspiration behind the order.
The High Middle Ages is a period in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in 1500.
The pursuit of technology as a collective term is a broad category, ranging from the pursuit of knowledge to the exploitation or enhancement of it as the result of human interaction with the laws of science and technological manifestation.
Many definitions of technological achievement fall into two broad categories: those in which technological development follows a general trend involving all kinds of cultural or political influences, and those in which traditional societies are susceptible to the vicissitudes of the times.
For example, a person may say that cars will follow an improved road.
However, the national road system is not economically viable with only a few cars, and new technologies have been developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The proliferation of automobiles, for example, has led to an increase in the number of accidents on the roads, which in turn has led to an increase in medical advances.
The extent to which peace would be achieved depended largely on the efforts of cultural figures, such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In terms of peaceful coexistence, man-made landscapes, and indigenous customs and traditions, these are in harmony with the land and are superior to any conflicting laws.
Just as Paris was the center of the fashion world, Constantinople was the center of medieval Europe.
It was a prosperous center from 400 A.D. to 1100 A.D.
Its decline began in the twelfth century when the Crusaders returned with gifts of silks and spices that cost more than the Byzantine equivalent.
At this time the headquarters of the famous International Exhibition of Textiles was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The wine was first influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, Western technology was slow to catch up, taking 25 to 30 years to catch up.
By the end of the Middle Ages in western Europe, they had developed their own distinctive style, which reached its zenith during the Crusades.
A subsistence farmer cultivates only enough food to feed his family.
Organic farming is simple, sometimes involving no fertilizer, the use of seeds from local plants and the harvesting of seasonal crops or simple fertilizers to increase crop yields.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, which is still practiced in developing countries.
A subculture is a group of people who share a common ideology and identity.
Subcultures may differ in age, race, class, location, and/or gender.
The identity that distinguishes a subculture may be linguistic, physical, religious, political, biological, national, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership in a distinctive way by adopting a set of norms, including dress, behavior, and language.
It is a sad commentary on the value of human relationships to see how many children grow up disadvantaged, forgotten, poor, victimized, and neglected by adults.
Children who are labeled as "disabled" or "underprivileged" are often detained and, in some cases, neglected because their parents refuse to accept their mental or physical disabilities.
Abused children often go through an abusive childhood before they are abandoned or run away.
Some are said to have been raised with animals; others are said to have lived outdoors with wild animals.
When raised with nonhuman animals, a feral child displays abnormal traits (within limits) that closely resemble those of domesticated animals, such as fear or prejudice toward humans.
Learning is based on making something that makes learning easier and more enjoyable, which is a major step up from scaffolding.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but is an aid designed to support individuals who are in the process of learning, such as using a computer program or starting a business.
The scaffold can be used for both online and face-to-face interactive learning, or in other words, the teacher is both a scaffold system and a Microsoft Office mini-clerk.
Scaffolds in Monalivalita are embedded in software and are designed to question, reflect, and explain instructions that are often difficult for students to see on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even financial exploitation.
No child deserves to grow up uncared for, unloved, and uneducated, but this is happening.
There have been sightings of shelters for such victims.
Our foster care system should provide a safe environment, loving care, quality education, and quality health care.
The orphanage had to supply the missing organs to the home where they were taken.
The Internet is a blend of social networking and social networking.
The sophisticated nature of the Internet adds another layer of complexity.
For example, "education" and "social interaction" have been proposed as important influences on Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal branding" and "continuous relationship branding" were also recognized as new developments by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they surveyed people's perceptions of websites.
The use of video recordings has led to breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, eye movements that occur within milliseconds.
In one experiment, they claimed to be able to tell if a person was lying by the accurate translation of microexpressions.
In his essay The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks wrote that those who are unable to understand speech because of mental retardation can still read it correctly.
He showed that the same mechanisms for transferring traits to humans also exist in domestic animals such as dogs.
Twentieth-century genetic research has revealed that there are two basic types of genes: those that are expressed and those that are not expressed.
Evolution adds a few new species, and natural selection removes them from the pool.
The process of splitting and recombining creates differences between the two age groups.
In the Savannah, it is not possible, for there is no hope of getting the nutrients you need from the trees.
But if the basic necessities of life are not met, anxiety, tiredness, poor health, and finally death result.
Nutrients such as proteins and legumes found only in vegetables are difficult to consume, and in many species, including humans, must be cooked before consumption.
By comparison, meat (carrots, shrimp, and eggs) is not only nutritious but also rich in essential amino acids.
If we think about it, though, we should not be surprised that our ancestors used their ingenuity to find solutions to "protein shortages", much as modern savannah cats do.
A nap is a regular period of rest (10 to 60 minutes) followed by sleep.
It may be easier to use a gentle alarm clock to awaken you gradually, at a set time.
If you decide to stay up later, it may be wise to move your alarm clock to another room, set it to wake you up, and turn it off.
Some study plans include drinking plenty of water or tea before going to bed to stimulate the urge to urinate.
In contrast, the greater a person's peace of mind, the more anxiety he stores up.
Reduce stress, increase the likelihood of good health and well-being, and increase the likelihood of finding contentment and happiness.
Only by letting go of personal weaknesses and anxieties in the pursuit of peace can we live a truly meaningful and satisfying life.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been extended to educate believers who want to learn Mahayana meditation and Indian yoga.
Buddhism, on the other hand, teaches a simpler form of meditation called Kundalini Yoga, which uses body movements to achieve a state of blissful union.
Kundalini Yoga uses the energy of the Kundalini to heal physical ailments, train the breath, chant the mantra and visualize enlightenment.
The essence of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. This visualizes the glorious existence of the deities and causes the energy channels to open and purify the mind and vision.
After World War II, in which the Soviet Union and the United States were allies against the Axis powers, the two superpowers were again divided politically and diplomatically.
Just two years after the end of the first world war, the old enemies faced each other again, and the Cold War began.
The war dragged on for more than 40 years and involved troops and proxies from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
Then, on September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was strengthened, and the hope was raised that Romania would withdraw its troops and resume the war in good order.
However, the intentions of the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Russia and Poland, the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and several other international treaties, in which two or more parties participated, were suspended, when the Soviet Union's Red Army, with 800,000 Russian troops, invaded (or forcibly occupied) the eastern part of Poland, forming the border with Belarus and Ukraine.
The weight of a ship's cargo made it possible to transport a large number of people and valuable cargo across vast oceans.
The navy's primary role is to support national defense by providing personnel and supplies, protecting the nation from enemy attack, and maintaining public order and safety.
For example, during the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, the United States tried to establish a naval presence in the Atlantic Ocean by sending troops and equipment to assist Great Britain.
At the same time, German submarines, typically U-boats, attempted to intercept the convoys.
If the treaty had not been ratified, Germany could have invaded Britain after conquering the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats in the Zagros Mountains of Iran dates back some 10,000 years.
Ancient tribes kept these animals for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Goats were raised on hillsides to graze, often under the care of young boys or young men, who acted as shepherds.
Horses were first used to pull freight trains in 16th-century England.
Horse-drawn wooden wagons had straight sides for speed and could haul heavy loads over rough terrain.
Wrought iron rails have been around for a long time, but it was not until later that it was realized that rails made of iron would be more durable.
This procedure was followed, and it seems that the wheels soon got back on their feet.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767, the world's first all-iron road was completed.
Two million years ago, with the rise of Homo erectus, humans began to walk upright.
Before that, Australopithecus did not always walk upright.
Fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 million to 3.9 million years ago show that they could walk upright, suggesting that Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can conserve our resources, we can join organizations that protect our resources, and we can take steps to minimize future risks.
We need to get to the root of the problem and eliminate it before it is too late.
Of course, modern science and technology have changed the world dramatically and have added to the problems of overpopulation and pollution.
After the Constitution was approved on July 4, a letter was signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson and sent to John Dunlap's printing press nearby.
Between 150 and 200 copies of what are now known as the Dunlap broadsides were printed overnight.
John Nixon read the letter for the first time on the steps of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to the troops in New York on July 9. A copy was sent to London on August 10.
Twenty-five Dunlap broadsides are considered to be the oldest known manuscripts of a book.
Many paleontologists believe that at least one type of dinosaur - the so-called bird - still exists.
Because they had wings and could fly, many would not think of them as dinosaurs.
However, many of the animals that have been found bear a striking resemblance to dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and pads, lay eggs, and walk on two legs like T-Rex
Most modern computers are based on binary code.
A binary number will always contain either a 0 or a 1, which are known as binary digits - or bits in computer language.
While the symptoms may not indicate immediate toxicity, drowning may indicate that immediate medical attention is not possible.
The presence of an open container of chemicals or cleaning products in the home can be an early sign of poisoning.
Check the label for emergency instructions.
Entomologists use the term "bug" to designate this group.
This ancient proverb is similar to that of the dung beetle, which is known to feed easily on human flesh.
Both the Assasin and the garden gnome survive in homes, sheds, and other natural habitats.
Nationwide, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common neurological disorder among adolescents and young adults.
MS affects your central nervous system, which includes your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may feel that they are not suited for each other or for the child they are raising.
The couple may decide to give the child up for adoption.
In an adoption, the biological parents lose custody of their child and the new parents gain custody.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the universe works scientifically - a goal that guides much of what scientists do.
In addition, experiments and surveys provide a basis for testing hypotheses and guiding research by asking questions and doing careful research.
Medieval historians and scholars were especially interested in medieval texts, especially Latin translations of the Bible.
Aristotle's ideas had a profound influence on science, including the study of logic.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, interest in Greek philosophy and science also declined.
Many who study the natural world are struck by the amazing design and function of living things, which seem to be governed by precise laws.
Many organisms - including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals - exhibit a pattern of behavior that goes beyond simple environmental changes.
Even in the absence of food, the body maintains its daily rhythm.
The work of Hershey and Chase led to the discovery that DNA stores and transmits genetic information.
Hershey and Chase took a bacterial virus and inserted its DNA into the bacteria.
They experimented with either DNA inside bacteria that contained radioactive phosphorus or proteins inside bacteria that contained radioactive sulfur.
Most of the changes that take place in an organism are the result of mutations, the most important of which involve the genetic code and changes in the reproductive organs.
While mutations in the reproductive organs may be passed on to offspring, other mutations can kill cells or cause cancer.
Ecotourism encourages tourists to explore the natural features of a place, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, camping, and exploring the natural world.
For example, we visited, printed, and studied the Bornean orangutan.
Early in the morning, people drive to work in their small towns and compete with one another on the roads.
In this system of transportation, all are connected and cooperate in one way or another, each using its own means of transportation.
Scientists have calculated that this outburst of greenhouse gases has altered the balance of our atmosphere, which has supported us for the past two million years.
Most people in a household use public transportation, and almost everyone complains about it.
In the developed world, you will rarely hear people complain about water shortages or the collapse of a dam.
Is it simply that the engineers are not doing their job, or is something more important going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is often difficult to monitor traffic because of the unpredictable behavior of drivers.
Yet, drivers seem to have their hands full; that is why roads are usually smooth and traffic flowing smoothly.
To visualize the movement of a truck, imagine that three quantities are involved: (1) motion, (2) force, and (3) velocity.
This interdependence plays an important role in planning, organizing, and managing transportation.
The first birds were insects, whose ability to fly enabled them to escape predators, find food, and mate.
Many small creatures can fold their wings alongside their body.
They could conceal their enemies in small, easily defended places.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, Aristarchus calculated that the earth, or the Solar System, orbits the sun.
They said that he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (as well as other stars).
Does that sound reasonable to you, since the universe appears to be stationary?
The Amazon River is the world's second-longest and second-largest river, holding some eight billion times as much water as the second-largest body of water on earth.
The Amazon is the world's longest river, at times up to ten miles [6 km] wide.
The Amazon once carried about 20 percent of the world's river water to our oceans.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of tributaries.
Evidently, the building of the pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, when the pyramids of Giza surpassed them in sophistication.

Most people are familiar with the alloys of gold, silver, and copper that are found in nature and that can be readily extracted with the right equipment.
Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that the universe was made up of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four fundamental states (the same order) of matter, gas, and plasma, and it is evident that he wrote that these states can be changed to produce physical matter.
An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Remember, most elements in nature are stable according to the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are known as metals, as are metals such as silver and gold.
Some metals are alloyed with nonmetals, such as carbon.
All matter is composed of atoms, which are the basic building blocks of all living things.
An atom is so small that a trillion atoms packed together would be about the size of the period that ends this sentence.
Hence, wooden pencils were popular when they first appeared.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of a new writing system, the wooden pencil fell into disuse.
Many people now write electronically instead of with a stylus.
If a new event occurs in the future, the same thing happens on the keyboard.
A fission bomb contains a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus and releasing some of the energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they can break apart without even being disturbed.
The moon's outer layer, the crust, is composed mainly of rock and dust.
The earth's crust is about 45 miles [70 km] thick at the poles and 60 miles [100 km] wide at the equator.
It thrives in marshy areas and is thickly covered with hills.
Maras can form close to where the earth's crust is soft or brittle, making it easier for lava to erupt from dry land.
Each issue is devoted to an area of concern.
Each of these theories suggests that humans have individual needs and/ or desires that are programmed into us at birth.
This theory focuses on what causes people to act in certain ways and explains how their environment influences what they do and do not do.
Two such theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
When a manager tries to exert authority over his former colleagues, two attitudes may result.
Such authority makes it difficult to make important decisions, to administer discipline, to monitor progress, to assign tasks, and to hold individuals accountable for their actions.
On the other hand, he is transformed into a person who sees the need to change everything about the team to his liking.
This is to be expected, since the success or failure of a team depends to a large extent on the leader.
This kind of thinking can create tension between the leader and the rest of the team.
The standards for electronic clubs are similar to those for other types of clubs, but there are some minor differences.
The team connected to the brain's electrical system acts as a communication system for the rest of the team.
The difference is that teams that meet virtually have different schedules, and each country may be unaware of the others.
The existence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is one of the distinct aspects of a team that meets in the electronic brain.
The "secret team" makes decisions and reports back to the rest of the team, proposing standards for the team to follow.
Why would any organization want to devote so much time and effort to creating yet another academic discipline?
When all the necessary tools are available to help an organization succeed, new skills and innovative thinking become evident.
An organization's ability to work together to solve a problem may lead to new ways to help those it serves.
For an organization to be at the forefront of innovation, leaders must foster innovation and promote the sharing of knowledge and collective learning.
Angel (2006) explains that the Continuum approach is used to help organizations improve the quality of their services.
The information gathered during an autopsy confirms the need for a thorough examination of the patient's medical records to ensure accuracy.

Trauma, lesions, and tumors have long been known to alter behavior and mental function.
Modern technology has enabled us to peer into the mind and its workings in ways never before possible.
He has provided us with a wealth of information and other knowledge on which to base experiments in psychology.
Of course, AI is often associated with science fiction, but it is also an integral part of computing, involving behavior recognition, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
AI research involves the creation of machines that mimic the abilities of intelligent life.
These include planning and preparation, responding to a person's questions and needs, and recognizing his gestures, voice, and facial expressions.
Rather than focusing on personality and physiology, it focuses on everyday problems.
AI systems have been used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in a number of home computers and video games.
School trips are an important part of the curriculum, and teachers often need to take their students to places where buses cannot reach.
Today's technology offers a virtual tour of the brain, allowing students to visit museums, visit aquariums, or admire handicrafts from the comfort of their classrooms.
Taking part in an electric scooter tour is a good way to share a trip or an experience from another class period.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a Web site for their annual trip to the nation's capital, which is updated annually, but the history stays online like a scrapbook.
Writing on a blog improves the quality of a student's writing. Of course, not all student blogs start out poorly written and misspelled, but they often change in the presence of an audience.
Since students are expected to judge the writing, the writer needs to improve in order to avoid being criticized.
Blogging "increases a student's awareness of his or her surroundings" and "promotes creativity and motivation" (Toto, 2004).
Blogging can encourage participation and encourage students to think outside the classroom.
A well-managed blog "can encourage students to think critically about a situation and evaluate all sides of it; an online diary allows students to verify what others have written and express their own opinions about a situation (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, the bilingual capital of Canada, is home to numerous galleries and museums that document Canada's past and present.

Some routes are available only to large airlines, while others are too expensive for smaller carriers.

If you want to fly business or first class, you should have a substantial amount of cash on you (if not, your airline should pay for it).

This means that if you want to fly from A to B, you can forget about getting a business or first-class ticket.
Airlines know that there will be wealthy passengers who can afford luxury seats.
