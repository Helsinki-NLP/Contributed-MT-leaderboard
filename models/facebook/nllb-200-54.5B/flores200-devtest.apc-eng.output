This not only confirms that dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a popular theory, but it also provides fine details that studies such as color and three-dimensional arrangement cannot detect.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown above with a yellowish undercoat .
The discovery also provides insight into the development of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other features of feathers - fins and scales - researchers concluded that the rachis was most likely a later gradual evolution of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that although this is a small bear, the specimen shows chicken feathers and not the feathers of a duck.
Researchers have suggested that although this is a juvenile bear, the specimen shows adult bird feathers rather than feathers from a duck.

Scientists have been able to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory predicts that most of the dark matter surrounding the galaxy is in the form of a crater, composed of many small particles.

She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may have been destroyed because her photo was widely circulated.
It is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and courts have considered that the publication of photographs may be prejudicial.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that ""journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish altered images of suspects""".
The Public Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made until at least an indictment was issued.
The leaked document also refers to a border dispute that Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 borders.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem as a holy site for both peoples and the issue of the Jordan Valley .
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed while the Palestinian Authority agrees to leave this presence for only five years.
Forest rangers in a complementary pest control experiment had to closely supervise the sprayers while monitoring the experiment and evaluating its effectiveness.
Through a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the manager in charge of park and heritage preservation with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday by a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council .
This is Martelli 's fifth temporary electoral council in four years .
A presidential commission last month recommended the resignation of the former electoral congress party as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections .
The committee came about as a response from Martelly to the widespread anti-regime protests that had broken out in October.
Violent protests have occasionally erupted over failed elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan 's Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry stated that it was aware of 27 hardware-related incidents .
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced last week that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable".
The earthquake hit the Marianas at 07:19 local time and 09:19 GMT on Friday .
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said damage was reported throughout the country .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there were no tsunami warnings .
A former Philippine policeman has taken two Hong Kong tourists hostage in a bus hijacking in Manila , the capital of the Philippines .
Rolando Mendoza aimed his .16 caliber rifle at the tourists .
A number of hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far .
Six hostages were released, including children and the elderly as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers were then taken to Mrs. Khetia's place because she needed to go to the bathroom, after Mendoza was shot.
Leggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
When Liggins was working at the hospital, he explored preterm labor in his spare time.
His research has shown that when given human growth hormone it accelerates fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" of the woman's records on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also expressed their appreciation for Luna .
"Luna was my first WrestleMania queen and my first manager. She died on a night with two full moons, which is a unique night for a full moon. Luna was a strong lady"," said Tommy Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust"" Runnels commented that "Luna was terrifying to me ... and maybe more so ... I love her and miss her ... I hope she is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic increased by eight percentage points from 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled hold the same opinion, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the height of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia would never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events and three events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaint, his fitness was called into question.
He could not take the necessary medication to overcome his pain so they were banned from participating in the games .
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery was confirmed by multiple people using different hardware and software in early February and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, when comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage .
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow airlines to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
Satellite-based technology is used instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport will be added and trains will not stop above ground at Wembley, and parking and ride-hailing facilities are also not available on the ground.
Concerns about lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game could be forced behind closed doors without fans in attendance.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is estimated to have taken much longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch and the migrating cactus finch.
Gold can be made into all kinds of shapes . It can be transformed into miniature forms .
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and twisted. It can be flattened or rolled into sheets.
They may have been made very thin and glued to another metal. Their work may have been so thin that they were sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This indicator is called the pH and is denoted by the symbol ph. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in PH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are electron-free protons (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Stir the dry powder together and then squeeze it into balls with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing them to tingle and form a kind of crust.
Each of the dwellings at Arba and Mohenjo-daro were equipped with flush toilets connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan houses on Crete and Santorini in Greece .
There were baths in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public baths where men's and women's baths were mixed together.
When you talk to someone thousands of miles away , you are using a satellite .
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back again, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and the view.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The bicycle has the potential to change the world in an incredible way. The most important thing the bicycle has given us is an easier and faster means of transportation.
We took the train , the car and several other means of transportation .
Below are medium-sized bison that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and antelope.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic feral cats) that eat more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the right environment, a special function for each cat that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, and they live in large groups called prides.
The groups consist of one to three adult males, plus about thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion tribe lives almost exclusively with packs of wolves or dogs, which are animals that behave much like lions (but not other big cats), and are very aggressive towards their prey.
As an all-around athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well) and swim long distances and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is considered to be in the same family as lions, tigers and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
And of course a tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar. It's more like a series of cries.
The axolotl likes to eat small animals. It hunts monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can. Almost all the animals the axolotl hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that sloths track animals for food (prey) by scent and inhalation during their time on land.
The wildcat can see well in the dark and moves silently. The wildcat hunts its prey by blending into its surroundings.
When a small group of organisms (a few populations) becomes separated from the main population from which they escaped (such as if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return) they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
The new environment contains different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be stronger competitors than it was before.
The natives have never changed, so they need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as new populations adapt to their new environments, they become less similar to other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, because it forms new species. It is an important and necessary process for evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants get their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. In addition, they save energy.
We build our houses from plants and make our water from plants and eat food from plants. But we do not think that without plants animals could not live.
Mosasaurus was the most powerful predator of its time, and was therefore feared only by other mosasaurs.
The long jaws are followed by a set of more than 70 serrated teeth, plus an additional set with a finished roof, which means there is no escape for anything that gets in its way.
We don 't know exactly but it probably had a forked tongue. It ate carp, large fish and other animals and may have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked everything that walked on water. Even the giant dinosaur T. rex was ahead of it .
Although most Roman food may not be strange to us, they do have some strange and unusual holiday foods, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called a vole.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to feast together comfortably on their sides during their meals.
Ancient Roman meals may not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and the ancient Romans never ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple to each of their gods, which was considered the home of the deity.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open sanctuary and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a private sanctuary of God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not very important.
Much of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just an open space along the road and the houses were built using stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the price of wood was high.
Greenland was settled independently. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, but travelled west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, however, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are all "Scandinavian" countries, there are many differences between their peoples, monarchs, histories, and traditional lineages.
If you watch the movie National Treasure , you might think that the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence .
That 's not true , although there is something written on the back of the bottle , but it is not a treasure map .
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence dated June 4, 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the page.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote the large (293‚ÅÑ4 in √ó 241‚ÅÑ2 in) manuscript document, it is known to have been bound when first released for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the symbols were simply added as a marker.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in an invasion code-named Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is an individual culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, as a community.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civilis meaning civil, which is related to Latin civis meaning "citizen". The word civitas means city or city-state, which in some sense determines the size of a society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint and equitable distribution.
Secondary cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
In the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and in the absence of a national executive or judiciary, relied on the often uncooperative state governments to enforce all its actions.
It also had no power to override interstate taxation and tariff laws.
The Articles required the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended, but these states underestimated the central government so much that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national football team, the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, as Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that constitute Japan, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical perspective, as an "archipelago".
The city of Taiwan has been inhabited since the 15th century and European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or Sweet Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, facilitating the shift to indigenous grain production and hiring Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Antihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can get a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been recovered and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common photographic format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
They are still produced today, but more importantly the aspect ratio is inherited from digital camera image sensor formats.
A 35 mm design is actually somewhat confusing; a 36 mm width and 24 mm height is preferred.
The aspect ratio of this figure (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the Advanced Picture System family of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The oft-misused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
It states that the most efficient placement of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see tiling).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, now rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound European countries together despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church coffers exist specifically for this reason.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the Church was in Rome, and this emphasis on authority and destiny has led many to question whether this doctrine has been fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international conventions over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from passing over entire sections of ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors of war in World War I, nations wanted to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each of China's stages or ruling dynasties was a distinct dynasty.
Also within each dynasty was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period that lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
Around this time, a fierce war broke out between various nobles who fought over the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history; thousands of people died in the struggle for supremacy in the Great Palace at Xi'an.
There were many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an autocracy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the state belonged to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of rank-based military classifications, they are now based on mental ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave known as Hira on Mount Noor for meditation.
The cave itself, which has remained throughout the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of a mountain to the north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is never easy to find it even if one knows of its existence. Once inside the cave, it is completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen but the clear blue sky above you and several surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C. is one of several large pyramidal structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids, the largest of which is the Great Pyramid, several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The largest pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" symbol takes the form of a V and the "down bow" symbol takes the form of a square without a bottom.
"Up"" means you have to pull the bow and squeeze it and ""down"" means you have to reach somewhere. Put your hand on the bow and pull it out".
The upper bow usually creates a softer sound, while the lower bow tends to be stronger and firmer.
Feel free to make your own marks in pencil , but remember that printed cursive marks are there for a musical reason , so they should usually be respected .
King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children Marie-Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4, and the King's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, on 6 October 1789, were forced in terror to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
They traveled by car back to Paris amid a large crowd of people shouting and cheering against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
On one occasion a member of the gang stabbed a member of the royal guard to death at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The Filipino people paid the costs of US imperialism's war of occupation in the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to defray a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
He asserted that the huge profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the principal gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar , you have to understand why they were created .
The time in which the events take place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological determinism to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a trajectory that goes beyond cultural or political influence, and that this technology has "effects" on embedded societies, rather than being socially determined.
For example, one might say that a car is necessary for road improvement.
The national road network is not economically viable for so few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The collective ownership of cars also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, which leads to the development of new technologies in health care to repair damaged organs.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe and Fichte.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and culture related to this geography arose, which were consistent with a society's status, rather than arbitrarily imposed rules.
In the same way that Paris was known as the fashion capital of the civilized world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of leisure began about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its prestige declined in the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were worth more than those offered in Byzantine markets.
At this time the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Clothing in the East was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
Because of slow communication channels, Western lifestyles can be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had developed its own style. One of the greatest developments of this time was the buttons people used to tie their shoes which was a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Shifting cultivation is a simple, often organic system, using locally stored seeds in a planter in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel excluded by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of belonging.
Subcultures may be differentiated by age, race, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a distinct subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership by a characteristic and symbolic use of style, which includes particular patterns, behaviors, and language.
One of the most commonly used ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by the adults they grew up with.
Some children are labeled as "brutal", and this label has been attributed to many people (often their parents) and in some cases this brutality results in children being rejected by their parents due to significant mental or physical impairment of the child.
Feral children may have suffered child abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Some are said to have been raised with animals; others are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised with nonhuman animals, a child may exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) that closely resemble those of animals such as fear or indifference toward humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and simpler, scaffolding goes further.
Incremental learning techniques are not a method of learning but an auxiliary tool that provides support to people who are embarking on a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
APIs can be both virtual and physical, i.e. a tutor is a form of API, as is a Microsoft Office assistant.
Virtual Scaffolds have been incorporated to help with questions and explanations of procedures that the student may not be able to solve on his own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not nurtured and cared for , but that is what is happening .
And we are convinced that the nursery system is a safe environment for children .
The foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes and caring people who provide stable care, education, and reliable health care.
The adoption agency is supposed to provide all the necessities that were not in the home before they were taken away from it .
The Internet combines elements of mass and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage patterns and saturation.
For example, "learning"" and ""socialization"" have been described as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were identified as new aspects of motivation by Amy and McCord 1998 when they conducted an investigation of audience reactions to Internet sites".
The use of video recording has made important discoveries in the interpretation of subtle expressions and facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
In particular, it is said that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks explained in his article "The President's Speech" how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can accurately assess honesty.
It has even been suggested that these abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with domestic animals such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
A mutation introduces a new genetic variant, which is selected against from the existing pool of variants.
Segregation and recombination shift variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
On the savannah plains, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to meet their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Failure to do so can also have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources are proteins that are found in leaves and legumes, but are difficult for humans to digest if not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "first protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep paralysis is when you deliberately wake up during your normal sleep period and fall asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively mild stimulant to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find it difficult to reset the alarm while you are sleeping , you can put it on the other side of the room , which will force you to get up from the couch to turn it off .
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces a person to get out of bed to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in his body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force, and the more one is able to find ultimate peace and contentment.
Anyone can become an intellectual. The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded through the Mahayana path of love and various techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is gained through yoga postures, breathing exercises and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and an enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war ended, clashes of order, practice, and culture led to the fall of the states.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies became the enemies they are today and the Cold War began.
It was intended to last 40 years and be fought by real proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other theaters.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Roman bridgehead.
These plans became obsolete almost overnight, but more than 800,000 Red Army troops passed into the Soviet Union and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of cargo ships is considered the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The mission of a navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were attempting to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this movement, mainly by submarines.
If the alliance failed, Germany would probably have been able to invade Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Many ancient cultures and tribes preserved them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and were often tended by goatherds when they were children or adolescents, such as the best-known goatherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carts were made only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and to pull larger loads over rougher roads in less than a day.
Crossties were introduced early to hold rails in place. Gradually it became known that rails were more effective if they had a strip of iron across the top.
This practice became widespread, but the iron caused excessive wear on the wooden wheels of carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first complete railway was introduced.
The earliest known means of transport was walking. Humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk as upright as they used to.
Two-toed footprints have been found in the fossil record of southern apes from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although people on the Chadian coast may have walked on two-toed footprints as early as seven million years ago.
We can choose to live in an eco-friendly way and join the environmental movement, and we can also be active in reducing future suffering.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases . However , unless we want a temporary solution , we must solve the problem at its root .
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed dramatically due to human scientific and technological progress, and the problems have been made worse by humanity's increasing population and wasteful lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was mailed a few blocks away from John Dunlap's printing office.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in Independence Hall Square on July 8 .
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Posters still exist and are the earliest extant copies of the document other than the original handwritten version.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived and lived to the present day. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have claws and they lay eggs and they walk on their hind legs like T. rex .
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in binary form.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer parlance.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine bottle or detergent bottle.
Refer to the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in the formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient word bedbug, which refers to insects that have adapted well to living with humans.
The mites and the beetle are symbiotic, adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that females are twice as likely as males to develop multiple sclerosis .
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a child .
These couples may choose to have an adoption plan for their children .
In the process of adoption, the original parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
By itself, an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and observe, as in scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior rely heavily on the presence of internal cycles and are produced by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms consisting solely of responses to external cyclic signals have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Circadian clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue for a period of free rotation even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key suggestions that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to transplant their DNA into bacteria.
Two experiments were conducted to determine whether bacterial DNA was present with the phosphorescent dye or bacterial protein was present with the phosphorescent sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells can only be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other lineages can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting and fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and getting to know orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns by car to go to their places of work and are checked in by someone whose place of work is next to theirs.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is connected in some way to a transportation system that depends on and supports their own vehicle.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems . Almost everyone complains about transportation systems .
Similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard in developed countries .
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints and fail on a daily basis ? Are transportation engineers incompetent ? Or is something more important going on ?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is a difficult subject because we cannot predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, both drivers behave the same way; therefore, traffic is fairly consistent and almost predictable.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between the three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wide variety of small prey items to hide from predators.
Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies .
Thousands of years ago someone named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
And that makes sense because we don 't feel the ground moving , do we ?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, containing more than eight times the amount of water found in the two largest rivers.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
Twenty percent of the water that pours from the planet 's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, collecting water from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids was completed by the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of size and technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the remains of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world with the smallest population.
The Vatican adopts the Italian language in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they can all be found in nature in their native form and are relatively simple to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed that all things are composed of a combination of at least four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
He likened the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he posited that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are several elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Of course, there are other minerals such as silver and gold.
You can get spikes that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon .
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Well, the pencil was the companion of many people when it first appeared.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new methods of writing, the pencil was relegated to lesser status and uses.
People are typing on computer screens now without having to ask permission .
One wonders what the keyboard will be like when something new comes out .
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to create a nucleus containing many protons and neutrons.
It is as if you are pulling a heavy car up a hill, so you split the core again to release some of this energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei which means they tend to decay with little or no propulsion.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust, and the outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 kilometers at the near side and 100 kilometers at the far side.
It is thinner below Maria and thicker below the highlands .
There may have been more lava on the near side because the crust was thinner, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories explore how certain people are influenced by the things they do and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
In general, such behavior can only occur when managers are led by their former colleagues. The person in the group tends to be "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes unrecognizable and feels compelled to change everything the group does and owns.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in problems between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same eligibility criteria as traditional teams, with a few minor differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often enjoy greater autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can be assembled to accommodate different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "unseen team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of the virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team that each member follows, and the invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to undertake a time-consuming process to create a learning organization? One of the goals of applying organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can be demonstrated when available resources are used effectively across organized functional departments.
As a result, the way the entire organization works together to overcome an obstacle can create a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating cognition. This narrows the field of research and makes it more rigorous.
The relationship between neuropathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and probe structures and processes in the brain that we have not seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, artificial intelligence constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have also been built into many computer software applications and home video games.
Field trips are a big part of any class. Often, the teacher will want to take her students to stores without the tour bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips , where students can look at artifacts in a museum , visit an aquarium or enjoy fine art while sitting in a classroom .
Participating in a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned each year, with older versions kept online as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often write their blog with poor grammar and spelling, the general public does not.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger suggests seeking to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become smarter about the world around them". The need to feed the public's interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that increases collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can allow students to become more analytical and critical; by responding effectively to Internet material, students can identify their own positions in the context of other people's writings as well as establish their own views on certain issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada 's past and present.
Farther south are Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as essentially Canadian to Westerners.
Vast areas in the north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited.
Compared to the population, this surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and is a self-contained continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated countries of France, and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, largely taking over the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Coast Range, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies: It is best to tell any passenger that you are married, regardless of their actual social status.
It is also a good idea to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Ladies should be aware that cultural differences may cause them discomfort such as being touched or holding hands and other things .
Be firm in rejecting men , and don 't be afraid to stick to your guns (cultural differences or not , it doesn 't matter!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
Destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt as Casa Branca, it was abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badia and Spanish merchants renamed it Casablanca when they established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Throughout the old town, it is common to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as crockery, pottery, leather goods, rugs and a whole range of jigsaw puzzles, but these are mostly aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city streets, especially downtown.
Since Goma is reasonably safe, we should look for any visits to Prat Goma to understand the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
A boda boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used to get around Goma . The average (local) fare is about 500 CFA for a short trip .
With its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu"" came to be used as a metaphor for distant foreign lands".
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation and airport have made it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to desert sand.
It was one of the featured stops on Henry Louis Gates' African Wonders of the World on PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more Arab than African in character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the borders of Mozambique in the east and Zimbabwe in the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting a different wildlife area.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is one of South Africa's largest National Parks (SANParks).
As is the case in all South African national parks, there is a maintenance fee and a daily park entrance fee.
It may also be worth buying a Wild Card , which gives access to a selection of South African parks or to all South African national parks .
Hong Kong Island is adjacent to the eponymous Hong Kong Territory and is the focus of what many tourists consider the main attraction.
They likened the procession of buildings that make up Hong Kong 's skyline to a glittering bar graph illustrated by the presence of Victoria Falls .
To see the most beautiful scenery in Hong Kong , leave the island and go to the opposite Kowloon waterfront .
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the North Shore.
This is where the British colonists settled. If you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, you can find it here.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) across the coastal hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest lying within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining stands of the great forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, almost a third of which is covered by water.
The Sanberdans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakarta / Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between areas are usually full, it is best to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small , comfortable , and durable Japanese coaster buses .
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby airports, such as Paro (No. 150) and Panaja (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and S√£o Jorge do Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The distance between the bridge and the road is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, but completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected.
The Guaran√≠ were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaicero and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadores with indigenous groups.
The Spanish colonial period lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world .
The biggest tournament of the year is being held in December at the Polo Grounds of Plaza Ca√±itas .
You can also watch smaller leagues and matches here at other times of the year .
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island 's only bank in Stanley in front of the FIC West store .
Pound sterling will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands , and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well .
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with the owners beforehand to determine the accepted method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands , so change money before you leave the islands .
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months temperatures can reach over 30 degrees Celsius.
Winters can be surprisingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity make the weather colder than expected.
There are no "wet" and "dry" seasons and the amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials , stay at least 100 yards / meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards / meter from all other wildlife !
If it is not smooth, bison, deer, moose, bears and almost all large animals can attack you.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don 't keep a proper distance . These animals are large and wild and potentially dangerous , so keep your distance .
In addition, you should know that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of naval confrontations in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except one British ship. About 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the assassination of paramount leader Topo Tamasese Lilufi III.
There are several routes, because Auckland is sandwiched between two of the most popular ports in the tri-state area.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and most offer shade from the Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Helier in central Auckland.
This is a family-friendly beach with a good selection of shops lining the shores. And swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer, but fun and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many kinds of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better for travel.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it is easier to find bottled water if you are concerned about the source and purity of the water.
For Australians, the concept of a flat white coffee is foreign. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino comes with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards , but the fruit juices are expensive but excellent .
Many reef trips are organized throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, I must take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near the shores and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking offers the traveler peace of mind because he will have a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Most travel agencies have deals with specific hotels , but you can also book places other than campgrounds through a travel agent .
Both types of travel are usually offered as packages that include entertainment, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or flight and hotel packages.
They can also make a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or help you get the documents you need for your trip (such as a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be reviewed by the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event , you should arrive early enough to get a campsite near the concert .
Remember that even though the music in the main theaters may be over, you may find sections of the festival still playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children .
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in the winter, check the cabin location, because ice traffic is so noisy that people are more likely to be affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg involve some time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos often go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are often windows and hours, and it can be difficult to find exits.
They often have special meals and entertainment to keep visitors in a good mood without having to leave the building .
Some establishments serve alcoholic beverages. However, sugar impairs judgment and all serious gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving their car at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or high temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive like that when you are on the pavement.
During blizzards, enough snow may fall to trap you in a very short time.
The view may be obscured by snow , fog or ice on the windshield .
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic can flow uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important for many visitors.
The popular term safari travel is used instead of wilderness travel to see the magnificent African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes can get very close to cars, allowing the standard equipment to see them well.
Lions , leopards and tigers are sometimes shy and are best seen with binoculars .
A walking safari (also called a "jungle walk", "hiking safari", or "walk") involves walking long distances over several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games since it hosted the 1964 Games.
If you book flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellations do not extend beyond July 2020, but the Olympics have been rescheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen , with regular tickets costing about 7,000 yen .
An iron can help dry wet clothes. Many hotels have an iron and a drying table available to borrow, even if no one is in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (as it may cause shrinkage or burn in extreme cases).
There are various methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute , while in other areas it may take several minutes .
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in a well-stocked bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter dangerous animals that they are not familiar with in their home country .
Epidemics can spoil food, cause irritation or worse cause allergies, spread toxins or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly infect or kill people, are not usually described as pests.
A duty-free shop is an opportunity to buy goods free of taxes and duties at certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can save money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it frequently passes through isolated forested terrain.
If you are used to driving on country roads , keep an open mind: there are often steep inclines , narrow lanes and sharp curves .
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than in previous and later sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence is more important than not.
Oddly enough, though, cell phone service is much stronger here than on many other stretches of the highway, such as the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
German pastries are very tasty, and Bavaria is very rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit puddings are popular; apples can be cooked in the pudding all year round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
A large number of German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other types of nuts. A strong cup of coffee is often served with the popular cakes.
If you want small , rich pastries , try the regionally named Berliner , Bavarian or Krabben .
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, curry milk is often used; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional foods found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualification, the term tends to mean the food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is widespread throughout the archipelago, and is characterized by a range of simply prepared dishes and the predominant flavours preferred by Javanese are peanuts, chili and sugar (especially Javanese coconut).
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide a great deal of stability for the rider. However, they can cause safety problems if two riders are trapped in them.
If a rider falls off his horse and his reins get caught in the saddle, he may be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most cyclists wear riding boots with smooth and fairly tight heels and soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety rails that allow the leather of the harness to fall off the saddle if the harness is pulled by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.
It is only from the summits that one can see spectacular views. And climbers from all over the world are constantly making new routes between its endless walls.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards on a sled.
Skiing is a major travel activity for a large number of enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski enthusiasts" who plan to spend an entire skiing holiday at a particular resort.
The idea of skating is very old - cave paintings depicting skaters date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski tourism: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring or snowshoeing.
It is related to but not associated with skiing or mountaineering tours, the latter of which are performed on steeply sloping terrain and require stronger skis and boots.
Take the ski trail to the hiking trail .
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than walking - but you rarely get to cross-country ski quickly without a heavy backpack with groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travel through several countries may require applying for visas and undergoing passport control multiple times.
However, the Schengen Area operates with only one country in this area.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, when obtaining a Schengen visa, you need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member state separately, thus saving time and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of manufactured items as antiques , but some tax agencies define goods that are more than 100 years old as antiques .
The definition has geographical variations, although life expectancy may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products may be labelled as antiques, although they are usually smaller than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami engaged in reindeer husbandry on a large scale, but lived by fishing, hunting and the like, and kept reindeer as draft animals.
